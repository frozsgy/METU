# CENG 465 - Introduction to Bioinformatics

## Course Objectives

The main objective of the course is to provide the student with a solid foundation for conducting further research in bioinformatics. By the end of the course, the students will have learned:

* the bioinformatics terminology,
* main bioinformatics problems,
* and the key methods and tools used in bioinformatics


## Course Content

This course covers computatioanl techniques for mining the large amount of information produced by recent advances in biology, such as genome sequencing and microarray technologies. Main topics of the course include: DNA and protein sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees, protein structure prediction, motif finding, microarray data analysis, gene/protein networks. 

## Homeworks

The homeworks can be divided into two subsections. The first and the second homeworks are reports of algorithms, whereas the last two are implementations of different algorithms using programming languages.


### [Homework 1](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG465/HW1)

### [Homework 2](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG465/HW2)

Constructing a profile Hidden Markov Model and aligning a new sequence using Viterbi algorithm

### [Homework 3](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG465/HW3)
