# CENG 477 - Introduction to Computer Graphics

## Course Objectives

CENG 477 Introduction to Computer Graphics introduces the basic concepts of computer graphics and raster based methods. It also provides the necessary theoretical background for introductory computer graphics and demonstrates the application of computer science to graphics. It also offers an opportunity for students to formulate and implement applications of computer graphics. This course further allows students to develop programming skills in computer graphics by programming assignments.


## Course Content

Hardware and software components of graphics systems. Output and filled-data primitives. Fourier analysis, convolution, sampling, quantization, aliasing. 2D and 3D geometric transformations. Two-dimensional viewing. Three-dimensional viewing: Viewing pipeline, viewing parameters, projections, viewing transformations, clipping. Visible surface detection. Introduction to illumination models and surface rendering.

## Homeworks

The homeworks can be divided into two subsections, namely Raytracing and OpenGL homeworks. The first and the second homeworks are different implementations of the raytracing algorithms, and the third and the last homeworks based on OpenGL. Due to a conflict with another course, I was not able to conclude the raytracing assignment, therefore they are not available in this repository yet.


### [Homework 3](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG477/HW3)

Implementation of an OpenGL program to render a given scene. (C++)

### [Homework 4](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG477/HW4)

Implementation of an OpenGL program to render flat Earth model using vertex and fragment shaders to display a texture image as a height map to fly through the scene interactively by processing keyboard inputs. (C++ & OpenGL Shaders)
