# METU Computer Engineering Programme
This repository includes all homeworks and assignments that was made by myself (and my team mates for some courses) while I was studying as an undergraduate student at [METU Computer Engineering Programme](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr).

## Quick Reminder 
This repository has no purpose to be used as "a repository of proper homework solutions". On the contrary, there are many "bad programming practice / programming horror" examples in this repository. However, I believe it serves as a good reference point to see how my coding style and perspective evolved throughout the whole process, and that's why I am keeping this repository public. If you're interested in "good examples", please check the following repositories:
* [CENG334 - Introduction to Operating Systems](https://github.com/frozsgy/ceng334-hw)
* [CENG336 - Introduction to Embedded Systems Development](https://github.com/frozsgy/ceng336-hw)
* [CENG435 - Data Communications and Networking](https://github.com/frozsgy/ceng435-hw)
* [CENG477 - Introduction to Computer Graphics - OpenGL Assignments](https://github.com/frozsgy/ceng477-hw)
