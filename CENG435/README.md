# CENG 435 - Data Communications and Networking

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course students will be able to:

* Understand the basic principles of communication protocols in the context of the Internet.
* Explain the operation and architecture of the Internet including the software and hardware components to provide Internet services.
* Compare and contrast various application layer protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS; connection-oriented communication protocols such as TCP and connectionless communication protocols such as UDP at the transport layer; virtual-circuit and packet switching at the network layer; link-state and distance-vector routing at the network layer; and multiple access techniques at the link layer.
* Explain the key features of mobile networks such as cellular networks and elaborate on the impact of mobility on routiing protocols.
* Devise protocols for reliable data transfer over unreliable channels, congestion control or flow control either in the user or kernel space of operating systems at the transport layer.
* Design and implement networking protocols at any layer of the OSI communication stack above the physical layer using socket programming interface.
