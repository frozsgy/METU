@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail

@SouthwestAir My boyfriend and I have LOVED @Imaginedragons since 2009 &amp; it would be so awesome to go to Vegas event. Any way you can help?
@AmericanAir thank you!
@AmericanAir why do you continually play the "according to federal regulations" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!

@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight

@AmericanAir in miami and the  agents Rachel Wong and Marisol Pimentel were very  pleasant in a world of chaos a BIG .thank u
@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@USAirways and at this point I don't need sorry, I need a revers agt to pick up the call so maybe we can make the 11:30 flight today
@JetBlue where is the "award winning service"?
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@USAirways Looks like I'm already delayed and will miss my connecting flight in Philadelphia. Do you un-delay your flights?

@JetBlue no, I am fine to fly! Haha, they come at random, with the hemophilia, but what if i need extra assistance
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@VirginAmerica can we make every VX plane with #nerdbird? Why should Austin be the only one getting nerd love?

@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@JetBlue Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ?

@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.

@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?
@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS.

@USAirways would love it if you could get my wife home sometime soon - she has been stuck in Orlando and now stuck in philly for too long
@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
@SouthwestAir Thanks I get that. It looks like all BWI-SJD services stops after Aug 7. Is that the case? I cant find one date with flights.

@AmericanAir @USAirways outbound flight: 2 hour delay b/c air traffic &amp; 2 gate changes dividend miles member gets no email or text updates
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
It really is nice, though. The snack fridge‚Ä¶that you can just get up and take stuff out, like a dorm common room, is genius. @JetBlue
@JetBlue Looking cool
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
@AmericanAir great job TYR ground crew...now let's get this bird outta here!!!  Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
@united how can you never got a flight from austin to Houston in time for a connection ever? Ever!
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.
@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
@SouthwestAir alas, it was pretty full so we had to entertain ourselves with witty repartee ...

@USAirways overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay...
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@united they wouldn't let me on. Real nice of you! Just love your awesome service. And U have 2 people working this customer service line..
@united I am UA elite Gold and have a UA Chase pres. plus credit card.  How many EQM's do I need to get Platinum Elite!

@SouthwestAir my rating for Southwest -9 on s scale of 1 to 10
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.

@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
@JetBlue yeah that's all been done. Define "incidentals"? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?
@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!
@USAirways #stuck in Florida with no flights... Service sucks here. #nofood #nodrinks #nohelp
@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..
@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.

@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&amp;B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't.

@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! üòú
@united I'm flying UA but *G with A3
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than "maintenance".
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
@SouthwestAir oh, is it only in Atlanta?
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
@USAirways International
BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! ‚Äú@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.‚Äù
@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
@united you guys are gay
@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.

@USAirways if my flight, 4035, is delayed, what time do I have to arrive at BHM?
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.
@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...
@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?
@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!
@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
@AmericanAir See photo of 787 model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/oilnCfWEyg
@AmericanAir when will you be issuing a weather advisory for RDU?? the entire state of NC has shut down from the overnight winter storm.
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@SouthwestAir No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple "no" would do; I just want to know. :)
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
@united When will you have special promotions for flights departing Newark, NJ to St. John's, Antigua?
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews first but Lady Gaga wow'd me last night. Carrie? Meh.
@USAirways @franchise02 my friend has been on hold for 1.5 hours and still counting!
Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@JetBlue hotspot free WiFi makes me happy. #jfk #itsthelittlethings
@SouthwestAir missing out on over 6,000 points in one account. They're now spread over four assuming I create accounts for them
@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
@SouthwestAir You guys are just being disrespectful at this point... learned my lesson about this airline
@VirginAmerica weather delays &gt; next few weeks ;) #JFK #BOS #DCA
@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
@united Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived @10AM &amp;website says they're still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy
@JetBlue we need an ETA please
@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@AmericanAir thank you for NOT Cancelled Flighting all flights and putting my husbands life in danger driving in this weather. #safetyfirst
@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
@USAirways @ClaudOakeshott how about a link that works pls Nothing but complete frustration w usair last 12 hrs
@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@SouthwestAir 10 revenue flights since the beginning of 2015?
@SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler
@VirginAmerica missed my flight. How does standby work?
@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight
@SouthwestAir flight #211pilot spilled his tea on the radio! Yay for delays! Almost an hour now!
@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV but of course! :-) #bestdressed #bluecarpet
Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR
@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back
@AmericanAir I remained on hold for 2 hrs to resolve my flight schedule &amp; your system hung up on me. #unhappycustomer
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson.
.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@AmericanAir got a callback at 1 am, took care of it. thanks.
@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
@SouthwestAir breaking my heart at BWI 9 hrs @business
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
@AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
@USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English).
@AmericanAir - thanks. She submitted a damaged bag complaint online...is there anything else we can do? #goodcustomerservice
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Xf9MPnAaJE
@JetBlue she's standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy
@USAirways absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!!
@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
@JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601
@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this longüòí
@AmericanAir stop sending me back to "customer relations "I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!
@JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can't join mine for a year???  Help me fix please.
@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls
@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
@united already missed  connection ugh
@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@AmericanAir Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz.
@JetBlue you guys rock!! http://t.co/LA397zaoAY
@USAirways "Owen F" at DCA Gate 42: #rude.
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
@AmericanAir Has AA Flight 296 from San Antonio to Dallas been Cancelled Flighted?
@SouthwestAir I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
@JetBlue TA off site at #thelodge. Should be a fun day. @YeniettElswood @AndrewBiga @CodyCleverly @HeidiMacey @motherpollock
@JetBlue @FerrisSalameh Love JetBlue's speedy Twitter customer service.

@JetBlue Airways Reveals 'Bluemanity' Livery - TravelPulse http://t.co/fTTfyFMvCO
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
@AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!!
@united no. U guys suck. I'll never fly with u again. And ur supervisors suck too.
@AmericanAir not sure why I would bother when the agent at the airport didnt help &amp; nobody on phone would. Ticket Cancelled Flightled for no reason.
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@united thank you
@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health.
@SouthwestAir Luvin me some flights today!! Don't change!!  And please add Paypal as payment option!!!
@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
@SouthwestAir thanks for getting me back to Nashville. Big thanks to the pilots on the 6:15 out of Baltimore. Flying in snow landing on ice.
@USAirways How will I change it?
@JetBlue does transferring trueblue points within family pooling members cost $? This is after having set up contribution-to-pool already.
@AmericanAir Still on hold. Way to suck.
@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your time!
@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available.
@SouthwestAir @CourtSnod hopefully Nashville is open. I want to come home today
@SouthwestAir Flying South by Southwest from SJC to SNA tiday http://t.co/KJKuVJ6CMo

@JetBlue this is awful! flight out of jfk for our honeymoon is delayed AGAIN until 1225 AM, and we lost money on a hotel now! #delayforwhat?
@usairways I've been on hold since 11:30pm how many customer service reps do you have? #seriously
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your "terms" response is insulting.  #jetblue
@JetBlue also. Emergency exit seats. 6'2" and that's a huge win.
@USAirways 5534. That's the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay
@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
@JetBlue thank you!! Miss you all so so much!! Is this the link to the blog? Or has that changed?
@SouthwestAir So frustrated with my experience with #Southwest. 18 hours trapped in Denver bc of mechanical problems. #worstcustomerservice
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company

@USAirways @AmericanAir  nvm my bad it's been an hour and a half #thanks
@SouthwestAir #CustomerServiceFail - - almost missed flight - long slow BWI ticket line: "Rather make a complaint or your flight?"
@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
@AmericanAir im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
@USAirways Gave up after more than 2 hours on hold. Still need that receipt; last time it was promised, it never arrived. Help?!
@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
@united @iamtedking http://t.co/UCZzP9YpHk click lounges tab. Need to be flying on supported S/A airline
@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
@SouthwestAir nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@JetBlue have a cpap machine for sleep apnea. Is this OK to carry on if I also have a small bag for clothes?
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@VirginAmerica CEO says #Southwest &amp; #jetblue have strayed from low cost model.http://t.co/96Sctomh29
@JetBlue My card company and I explained the issue over the phone when I was in Mexico. I purchased a new ticket over the phone.

‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/aJM3BhJVaa‚Äù #foh
@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
@SouthwestAir just disconnected my call after 2.5 hours without even speaking to me. #octaviannightmare
@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.
@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
@southwestair,  kudos to your rep "Patricia" at gate B11 this Sunday morning at #Chicago #Midway #MDW,‚Ä¶ http://t.co/MmCWkqp2gy
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(
Oh yeah? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FTv2NWWQF1‚Äù
@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?
@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@SouthwestAir no one has answers...no one can help. There is always a different story to why my and my fiancee' can't be helped.
@JetBlue Thx for the pointer, but Im good with the big monitor.  Any advice on who I should pick to come our of the Western Conf (NBA)?
@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
@AmericanAir  MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
@JetBlue mission accomplished: gave @paulgordonbrown  a hug http://t.co/LT1pYKfvRq
@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?
@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the "we'll call you when someone is free" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up.
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@AmericanAir @cheerUPDATES So you're saying the call center is understaffed?
@USAirways tough night, two 90 minute calls, on hold, delayed here in Phoenix for two days because of one aircraft not ready? Not acceptable
.@AmericanAir Also, not the reservations team's fault. Bad top-down decision. I feel bad for the reservations AND social media teams.
@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
@united I will. I have to get to Bangkok. I have just 17 days to spend with my husband in his mid deployment leave. Like to get there asap
@united on SFO-&gt;AUS UA343 2/17, IS9JX1; my seat appears to have had a mite problem. Dr recently confirmed over 50 bug bites were mites
@JetBlue I want to enter the family pooling contest, it says "by 2/19" on the website, can I please enter still!
@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
@USAirways it's flt 4827 to ELM - still no gate and still have to make it thru customs
@JetBlue I would love to Fort Lauderdale now that would cool.
@AmericanAir although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service
@JetBlue thanks...
@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.
@JetBlue dang. Pandora? Does it look like it may get pushed back more or is this likely it?
@USAirways 3hr30min right now...  any end in sight?
@AmericanAir I have "continued contacting" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid.

@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport

‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vw2v8GVnGq‚Äù üòêüòë
@JetBlue Indeed. I don't know what's going on in Pittsburgh that weekend, but, it's drawing a crowd via JetBlue!
@united two years old.  Birthdate 11/13/2012
@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
@USAirways @AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG ?#SOS ITIS BEING LOST FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS ! #POORCUSTUMERSERVICE
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
@SouthwestAir why can't you take me to Knoxville?? yall are my fav #help
@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
@JetBlue the free wifi makes up for the television not working... It's staticy #ithelpsabit
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united Definitely will!
@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound
@AmericanAir why did you drop my call. Why don't you have more people answering phones? Why is it always high call volume when I call
@USAirways  Flight 4454 aircraft at gate, but no crew?  Will be 2+ hours Late Flight to destination. Come on!
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for 30 mins at PHL waiting for someone to load baggage,ridiculous http://t.co/BRCsjBxG2s
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@JetBlue? | RT @WMCActionNews5: New airline expected to make its way to MEM http://t.co/vO3eQsEPqH
@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@JetBlue is there also a way I can get a printed one for my records? I keep them whenever I fly ;)
@SouthwestAir is it possible to book a refundable trip? Willing to pay extra. This would be for a domestic round trip flight
@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you.
@AmericanAir Well if you won't let me handle my reservation/change online, &amp; your Reservation call # hangs up on me wtf do I do?? Bullshit.
@JetBlue we are bringing 2 guitars. can we bring them as carry on?
@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
@SouthwestAir to start daily #B737-700 flights from #Columbus OH to #Oakland on 8AUG #avgeek
@VirginAmerica  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
@SouthwestAir extremely #disappointed with poor the customer service provided after Cancelled Flighting my flight today! #unprofessional
@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@united question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
@JetBlue beautiful ride. Thanks again:)
@AmericanAir I still can't get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help!
@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.#socialtantrum
@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 55 mins about my Cancelled Flighted international flight. Am out of country, so can't leave a call back #. Help?

@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check
@AmericanAir what about flight 1239?
@AmericanAir Hello ! I cannot register for my tomorrow flight from Paris to Las Vegas "This feature is currently unavailable" appears ?
@USAirways  that would be lovely! You have great people working in your organization.
@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
@AmericanAir I was going to change it to tomorrow because I am concerned if the fllight does make I won't be able to leave the airport   1/2
@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
@USAirways obviously your corporate definition of PATIENCE needs to be reviewed.#Pleasehurryup #answerphone #reschedulemyflight
@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@SouthwestAir Officially a customer support game of wills... 2hr30 on hold... Who's the loser here? Oh yeah, that's me.
@SouthwestAir Yes! Just a few minutes after my tweet. She was able to reschedule her flight. Thanks!
@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a "premium" cabin?
@USAirways I finally spoke to a person. Despite the mind boggling wait time, the rep was very pleasant and very helpful. Kudos to her.
@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage
@SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience
@AmericanAir watch out if you are a parent...they break stroller &amp; tell you look at the fine print
@united false.
@united flt 912. Capt Herman is amazing! Came out before flight to play "ask the captain anything." Wonderful ambassador to the airline!!
@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk
@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse.
@SouthwestAir haha, thanks for the explanation
@united @annricord January 15th.
@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
@united thanks for updating me about the 1+ hour delay the exact second I got to ATL. üôÖüôÖüôÖ
@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@AmericanAir No one answers phone, delayed/Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. You only get (I'm sorry, we apologize) blah blah blah. Bad
@SouthwestAir on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
@AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.
@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever.
@SouthwestAir A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives???
@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should‚Äôve had yesterday, it‚Äôs $514 today. Thanks.
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
@SouthwestAir I will say that your customer service has consistently been the very best!!!
@JetBlue I'll pass along the advice. You guys rock!!
@JetBlue Traveling with two kids tomorrow (ages 7 and 4) domestic, do they need birth certificates to check in at airport?
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@AmericanAir On flt 1627 from DFW to FAT on 2/23 and it was 86'd. Can you rebook me on the 1359 flight tonight? Can't get through on phone.
@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
@united we have been told that it's lost...you guys don't know where it is
@USAirways TRBL experience! 2 hrs on the Tarmac for an inch of snow IN PHL "No hanger open" &amp; "a pile of snow"?  #terriblecommunication
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@SouthwestAir Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?
@AmericanAir you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!
@SouthwestAir thanks for the follow up.  I appreciate it.
@AmericanAir I need to change a ticket and my res can't be changed online.  I also can't get a call through due to high volume--can u help?
@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
@JetBlue BEST SEAT ON A E190 to board early. READY. SET. GO!
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to "listen to the intercom better".
@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
@JetBlue using A321 JFK-SEA for Summer 2015. It will be my first A321 flight ever! No Mint to Seattle, Core Config only.
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
@SouthwestAir Looks like brooding skies out of ONT this evening. http://t.co/X9BLwgWA68
@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)
@AmericanAir they @cathaypacific @cathaypacificUS can't even tell me what country they are in üò•üò•
@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
@VirginAmerica hi I just booked a flight but need to add baggage, how can I do this?
@USAirways stuck at the gate in Charlotte, NC waiting for "release papers" and a fix for a broken computer system.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/g12sn5qsqZ‚Äù- no... Yall better than this
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
@AmericanAir make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru.
@JetBlue Tomorrow wouldn‚Äôt have been soon enough! Thank you for the info!
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
@SouthwestAir On hold with airline 45 min and counting. Service is terrible!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/RLWBJ80mA5‚Äù r u serious
@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in‚Ä¶ 40 mins‚Ä¶ and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@JetBlue unfortunately no, but hoping I can catch one sometime in the near future!
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
@AmericanAir I Love American Airlines :D
@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it.
@SouthwestAir Leave BUR ten minutes Late Flight and arrive in SJC a minute before we were supposed to... Impressed! #gettingbetter üëç
@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
@SouthwestAir yeah, all 4 are rebooked for tomorrow AM. Hoping the 3rd time is a charm for no Cancelled Flightled flights!
@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
@AmericanAir I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@SouthwestAir üòÖ you won't let me change my reservation online so now I'm just wasting my time. http://t.co/mHA3xXaeD5
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
@SouthwestAir in flight wifi + @TMobile wifi calling makes for the best combination. Who doesn't love texting 40,000 feet in the air :D
@JetBlue to offer service from Daytona Beach to New York - Albany Business Review http://t.co/dUhBJ41jHx
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
@USAirways can you please post wait time-have been on hold for two hours
@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta!
@USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United
@AmericanAir I need to order a special meal and I can't reach AA. Been on hold for over 2 hours
@USAirways Will do. I appreciate the response.
@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help. Fabulous staff at gate D4 helped-2 young men handled crowd well.
@southwestair has 22 employees on Social Care Team, 4 staff the Listening Ctr. at any time-rest of spots filled by other areas. #RaganDisney
@AmericanAir right on cue with the delaysüëå
@VirginAmerica SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
@SouthwestAir where are our pilots? Plane is here flight says it's still on time, but we should of been off the ground 15 minutes ago.
@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@SouthwestAir I miss mine terribly. A +1 for my 30th anniversary would be amazing. It would mean LUV is in the air. #dontmakemebeg
@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@USAirways I have contacted them but only got an automated response that won't give me the code.
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE

@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
@SouthwestAir here is my conf #F8NEQM. My flight was delayed for 3 hours while my friend waited for me on her bday. Please follow up.
@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
@AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!
@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!
@USAirways the gate agent said "it's booked in full. Sorry" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land.
@USAirways thanx but this isn't my first rodeo. Done &amp; done yesterday. No results or comm, unless u count status: bags lost &amp; claim filed.
@VirginAmerica would love to do more for virgin just like I do for @GoPro
@USAirways - been standing at the gate for 45 min trying to go standby bc I will miss my connection. No help! Do NOT fly US AIRWAYS!
FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - "we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol

@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp; a beverage. Easy cheesy
@USAirways but the automated message says the line is too busy to join the queue! #stuckintheloop

@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!

But, are your flight attendants fucking tho? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/wGYzTnjCXm
@USAirways have you ever lost luggage with an infant and a 4 year old? Then customer service never answered the phone. I've tried all night.
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@JetBlue @Leopolds_IC  No but my friend in the picture - Phillip Heller (JFK IFC) did and he said it was delicious!
@VirginAmerica ‚Äã is flying from Love to Austin now. That is most excellent news.
@SouthwestAir while you clearly didn't care about our troubles yday thought I'd share bags took &gt;90min and came back absolutely drenched..
@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
@united Denver baggage handlers you totally impressed us today. Our lungs barely made the run to connect but our bags had no problem! #DEN
@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.

@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim.
@USAirways do you have an email??
@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons Any word on winners of contest? Any chance for tix for the Provo DestinationDragons show? Fingers Crossed!

@united 65 and 72 year old flying to Tokyo for vacation both with bad knees and this happens https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu @cbcallinaday @CBCNews
@SouthwestAir it was this one but looks like the problem is now fixed. https://t.co/CFI1E3KXA9
@JetBlue Well, thankfully they've got a nice food court here...When will an update be posted?
@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
@JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx
@JetBlue do you know when the schedule for dec 2015 will be released?
@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement
@SouthwestAir What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. üòë
@JetBlue ‚Äôs Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@AmericanAir are flights from Columbus Ohio to Dallas Texas Cancelled Flighted?
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@VirginAmerica thanks guys! Sweet route over the Rockies #airplanemodewason
@JetBlue flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed.
@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!
@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure
@SouthwestAir is really gonna hear my mouth about this bag situation.
@united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
@united @delta lost my luggage from ATL to  hdn luggage in denver and said @united will deliver my luggage to HDN airport claim# hdndl11785
@SouthwestAir - I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?
@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife
@AmericanAir emailed AAdvantage for status match ... still waiting.  Can't wait to move from @united but help me out here :)
@USAirways where's my apology?
@AmericanAir I will and I will share with many, many others. #filmcrew #media @WSJ @nytimes @latimes @chicagotribune
@AmericanAir a confirmed flight. I'm so done! Thanks for nothing!
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@SouthwestAir kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500
@usairways @AmericanAir LAX connect from term 6 to term 4.  55min layover due to delay. US755-AA2595. Is this realistic? Can 2595 be held?
@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
@SouthwestAir This has to be the best video I have seen ever! - #teamspirit https://t.co/X5JenA7NyE
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm.
@SouthwestAir - did SWA send out customer surveys to earn $100 toward flights? Is this legit?
@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow.
@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site
@united kind of cool to run into your boss man at SFO. http://t.co/bm9O2K5X5J
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@AmericanAir @CNN @nbsnewsr @cnnbrk except you aren't working with her @AmericanAir youve done nothing to help
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
@united 757 N33103 taxies @bhx_official departing as UA26 to Newark Liberty Airport http://t.co/IALiCEH2FT
@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd.
@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ...
@united was never given one
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@united how come I have no baggage updates.
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair
@JetBlue any idea when November-December 2015 travel opens up?
@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
@JetBlue all up to date. Can't update via Google play.
@VirginAmerica Thank you for the follow
@SouthwestAir That's an awesome library.
@USAirways your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me!
@VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :(
@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes....
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@SouthwestAir I just wanna say you're incredible for sending people to see their idols. Sooooo kind and amazingüíñ #DestinationDragons
@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
@SouthwestAir when are the two free flights promo coming back?! Looking into the premiere card but might hold off or go with another option!
@VirginAmerica and again! Another rep kicked butt! Naelah represents your team so beautifully!! Thank you!!!
@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
@USAirways @Beamske But maybe I can be on hold for 30 minutes again. That would be just as amazing.
@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
@JetBlue @cflanagian she's on to something
@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@SouthwestAir now on hold for 2.5 hours waiting to speak to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight from Philly to ORL
@USAirways his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@SouthwestAir do new flights come out at midnight?
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@USAirways How long before departure do gates stay open? Will I make my connecting flight 1861 to RDU from flight 894???
@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
@USAirways also, can you explain why, when I checked in, on the US Airways site, &amp; picked "Standby for 1st" I was not put on the list?
@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
@united Sure.  Follow for a sec and I will.
@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less
@AmericanAir my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can't get through to reservations!
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ
@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@SouthwestAir can't wait! Thanks for the response!‚ù§Ô∏è
@SouthwestAir Any way you can help with entry to Vegas event? My Boyfriend &amp; I have been @Imaginedragons fans since 2009. They are awesome!
@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping out! Class act, all the way... see you in the air!
@united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.
@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!
@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
@AmericanAir my itinerary was from EWR TO DALLAS to LA. You Cancelled Flightled my flight, you have my money, find a way to get me there from EWR
@AmericanAir thank you we got on a different flight to Chicago.
@JetBlue Hello! Can you tell me if you currently fly to Hawaii? Thanks!
@SouthwestAir one of my bags didn't make it to my destination. I have the claim ticket. Any way to help out with a status on the location?
@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@AmericanAir follow me back so I can DM you guys
@united thnx!
@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
@united I'm on snowy roads to BWI. I Just called MileagePlus &amp; told flight was Cancelled Flighted 1 1/2 hours ago. I rcvd no notification. Pls help
@usairways we've been on hold for 2 hours trying to reschedule our Cancelled Flightled flight. Can anyone out there please help us?

‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBM6PAbORt‚Äù &lt;&lt;Now THAT is fuckin funny. üòÇ
@united thank you!
@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145.
@SouthwestAir flt 3867 crew  #OrangeCounty to #Denver is The #BEST! Weather delay but pilots just invited the kids to see the cockpit! #luv
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. üò† #frustrated!
@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
@AmericanAir This is very true. Another reason why we stay South in the Winter months of travel http://t.co/fgJbex480D
@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
@united no still trying to get home.
@united for a fee...
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@united SATURDAY this morning Man dies from Ebola http://t.co/hXVVIS0VWw
@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
@virginamerica you ROCK for making it so I can watch #Oscars on my flight!! #redcarpet #oscars #oscars2015
Thanks @SouthwestAir ! #heartlanta
@SouthwestAir y'all are fast we already have our 5 winners! Congrats!!
@usairways hopefully your crappy service improves as u become @americanairlines #angryairtravel #winterstorm
@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
@USAirways call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person.
@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
@SouthwestAir did you Cancelled Flight ALL flights into BNA today??? #needtogethome
@JetBlue by any chance do u offer fresh guacamole on your flights
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening "in front" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@USAirways Ann Marie at LGA is the best ticket agent ever! #excellentcustomerservice
@AmericanAir really
@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?
@SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing.
@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
@SouthwestAir I need to request a refund on my flight that was Cancelled Flightled this morning due to the weather.
@SouthwestAir it's ok...I forgive you guys.
@AmericanAir When did they start to sell water @AdmiralsClub ?
@JetBlue thank you for incredible customer svc from gate to flight. Mint experience is magic.
@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
@SouthwestAir 2/22-MDW 2 SAN flt 1687 attendant Melissa was awesome! Fast, smiling, great. After weather Cancelled Flight day b4, it was welcome
@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
@JetBlue can you DM?
@JetBlue got txt  40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived @ JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight.
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
@USAirways Thank you, although we're using our miles from our card and Flight Booking Problems companion tickets which can only be booked over the phone.
@JetBlue It's absolute madness in the west, but tell me who you like between @memgrizz @warriors @spurs and @okcthunder
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@AmericanAir amen!
@AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke
@VirginAmerica what is your policy on flying after surgery?
@united smiling? NOT!!
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
@USAirways Website won't let me change online even though airline issued travel advisory, now on hold for 50 minutes. Help.
@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
@AmericanAir there's a lot of talks and no doing. MIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame http://t.co/TwETPXUpPN
@AmericanAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@JetBlue can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch..
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@VirginAmericawjere is our luggage #so slow at lax
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united followed &amp; DM'd.
@united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uKM4e99Dz0‚Äù lmaoooo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@united understanding the situation we waited and it was opened until 10:30pm
@VirginAmerica thanks so much!
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
@USAirways your app sucks balls compared to @AmericanAir
@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!
@SouthwestAir following!! My bad.
@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
@USAirways I wasnt  flying your airline tonight, however a friend was and I was present for her help. I flying United and they could learn.
@USAirways with this livery back in the day. http://t.co/EEqWVAMmiy
@SouthwestAir crazy hold times today. Over an hour now. Help?
@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
@SouthwestAir baggage woman said it was in Blatimore and would be on a plane this morning. Now they can't find it. WTF!???
@AmericanAir one of my luggage didn't made it onto my flight, hope it really gets here tomorrow, as I was told üòìüò≠
@AmericanAir Joanne from your San Diego staff was phenomenal! Give that girl a raise. She handled our #flightnightmare better than anyone.
@AmericanAir Do you happen to know if that plane will be repainted, or fly "off into the sunset?"
@VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X
@USAirways stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for "sickcrew".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today.

@united that would be great - 1k us651621
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@JetBlue im flying with you from mi-boston and then icelandair to iceland, 8 hours between. can we check our bags all the way?
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
Brands: Stop this shit. No, stop. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/sKEbqKtxvX
@SouthwestAir Flight was Cancelled Flighted, I've been on hold for 50 minutes with no human interaction. I wanna get away.
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
@united Your "Loyalty Team" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google "loyalty" and get back to me? ^LOL
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
@united flight to RSW tonight -me &amp;  twin 3 year olds. A pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys &amp; bags off. Lifesaver!!
@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution
@SouthwestAir that's why I fly y'all, that personalized service
@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
@SouthwestAir can I use points to book a rental car?
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol üòÉ
@JetBlue lmfao, i love it
@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
@AmericanAir probably had money on @BensonHenderson they said to hell with @Cowboycerrone lol
@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
@SouthwestAir how do I go on the scavenger hunt if I'm in Boston?
@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says "try again Late Flightr, goodbye".
@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.
@SouthwestAir done
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
@USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn‚Äôt enough. #freedrinkcoupons
@SouthwestAir Hello SWA, Who is your POC for partnerships with nonprofit organizations in BWI area?

@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin
@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service
@JetBlue @Cayman_Islands  I know that bar :)  Wish I was there now!
@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
@AmericanAir. It's been 5 hours and still no call and now we are back to being hung up on by an automated system.  #AmericanAirlines
@USAirways flight 850. RUDE RUDE RUDE service! Awful.
@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@JetBlue once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@SouthwestAir @flightspots about time! #mobileboarding is a must!

@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations.
@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?
@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?

@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.

@VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven‚Äôt heard! I‚Äôm flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate?
@JetBlue there's is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true.
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous

@USAirways is useless airways. Day 2 trying to get home on standby as a result of their Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways

@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option.
@SouthwestAir thanks, already subscribe and have a RR Account. Had received a promo code last month but has since expired. Any new offers?

@AmericanAir sent

@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@JetBlue @martysg Spoke to Corp. Customer Support already.  Shame.  Probably a reasonable and cheaper resolution to be had.  Regards
@SouthwestAir  reservation (FEHQNE)  21FEB15 | DCA-RSW. Want refund not credit for Cancelled Flightled flight please.
@united haven‚Äôt before and haven‚Äôt this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case‚Äînothing
@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@United Right now at Tropic Air in San Pedro, #Belize. Line out the door. All due to elected &amp; appointed hacks http://t.co/kKEDjNRTWo‚Äù
@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now

@JetBlue and a HUGE thanks to the crew on flight 1348 who flew in to DCA from SJU Monday night in the snow so we could have a plane!!!
@SouthwestAir weren't too "sincere" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home..
@SouthwestAir Traveling with a 13 year old Thursday. He does not need an ID, correct?
.@JetBlue That's what I planned on but Boston traffic due to recent weather was insane! If I had been expedited I would have made it.
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
@USAirways not impressed with your customer service. everyone has been unhelpful and incredibly rude.
@JetBlue haha. TY. Do you know what time that lane opens at Logan?
@AmericanAir I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?
@USAirways cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before
@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
@AmericanAir been rebooked for tomorrow. You failed to put me on DL flight today despite my asking and available seat. DL still available
@AmericanAir would also like say kind move on adding the points !
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons  Did they pick someone for Destination Dragons?
@united Thanks. Got it straightend out last night.
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been "reticketed" on.

@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
@JetBlue it will be glowing. Your crew and your aircraft sparkled. You guys know about @nokidhungry right? Might be a good partnership:)
@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a

@SouthwestAir I have a flight on Sunday the 22nd to Columbus from Denver. I just got a travel alert on my southwest app. Is the rescheduling
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
@SouthwestAir I wrote to your customer support on Monday re: a Cancelled Flighted flight but haven't heard back. Any idea what's up? Thanks.
@SouthwestAir were you handing out tickets while I was sleep ?

@united Hi, booked a flight yesterday and received an email w/ confirmation number but today I got this error "no active flight segments"
@USAirways  ! THE WORST in customer service. @USAirways ! Calling for over a month to book a flight! #poorcustomerservice #usairwaysfflyer
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@AmericanAir POOR EXPERIENCE 2day at ord chkin. 8 emp. w/3 cust. 10 waiting. Asked to speak w/supervisor. Told 20 min. In a mtg!! What?!?!
@SouthwestAir so the fares I see for flights in fall are the ABSOULUTELY LOWEST they will be?

@JetBlue That's great! Thank you.
@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@JetBlue you found my camera!  Thank you!  You rock!

@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.
@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.

@united that's cool - now what?
@united thanks for delaying my flight for an hour, and then boarding us onto a flight that REEKS of vomit because it wasn't cleaned properly
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@united 100% I will put together a very serious email, with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
@SouthwestAir chances of flight leaving BNA tomorrow at 6:20 am (to LGA)?
@JetBlue you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline!
@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
@USAirways Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn't go
@AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using "weather"
@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.

@united where's the crew for ua748?
@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we‚Äôre told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don‚Äôt.
@USAirways so I guess you are ok with people being sexually assaulted on your flights nice customer service
@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
@JetBlue Gerne :)
@VirginAmerica - too many apologies! You r the worse airlines! Don't even respond to your cudtomers

@JetBlue ok thank you for the quick response JetBlue still the best comp
@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #.
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@SouthwestAir flying back to Denver tomorrow. Should I rebook?
@USAirways any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting...
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@USAirways @ALfamilyoffour maybe if there was anyone answering the phone they would. "Please call back Late Flightr".For 18 hours? Not good enough
@SouthwestAir want to explain why I was on hold for 2+ hrs tonight trying to reach customer service only to learn they're only there Mon-Fr?
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your "customer feedback"
@SouthwestAir Thank you. Great tool
@AmericanAir hi how are you
@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.
@SouthwestAir Loved one's flight ATL to IND Cancelled Flightled due to "ice in Indy". Sitting here in Indy, it is bone dry. Tomorrow 4-6" of snow.

@AmericanAir I got rebooked on on us airways by you guys but the flight I got won't work. Any help would be appreciated.
@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?
@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
@VirginAmerica had me at their safety video . . . http://t.co/CqMm7nuE9m  LOVED my first cross country flight. #livewelltraveled #sytycd
@SouthwestAir yes I was everything worked out great

@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, concerned abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?
@SouthwestAir DM sent. Thanks for the help!
@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call "customer service" in the future now.
‚Äú@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that's not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That's a certain #fail Fix it plz.
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@JetBlue - In CA for the weekend to attend a training camp; thanks for sending all my gear to FL; looks like this trip is a waste #nothappy
@united Beyond frustrated  Sked change = no seats, earlier departure and double layover.  Of course only seats are $$++.  Cust svc no help
@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@SouthwestAir Can you give me info on Flt 681 out of BDL? I see it's Cancelled Flightled.
@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@united I tried.   We were hung up on, twice. After speaking with someone, then put on hold for 45 minutes.  No resolution.
@USAirways Many thanks for your reply! http://t.co/6CGFv02gzb
@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call.

@JetBlue I did...#FlyFi worked well and was free aboard this flight
@SouthwestAir had an amazing experience with your staff at DIA last night. I was blown away by their hospitality with my wife on crutches
@SouthwestAir your WiFi is shit. fix that up before I jump out of the closest bloody fucking emergency exit.

@united Seat 14A, Flight UA895
@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@SouthwestAir #3252 Manchester-BWI being delayed for one idiot who isn't on the plane?! We've waited 2 hours for our window and may miss it
@usairways  US1799 CLT-&gt;SFO in first no desert, no snack basket. Incoming was on time ? What‚Äôs up?
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@SouthwestAir round-trip tickets just arrived for our auction at the Post-Masters Invitational! Thanks Southwest! http://t.co/mRfBjtePef

@united They held the plane! Made it!!
@USAirways but I've been trying to call them since yesterday and I keep getting hung up on? Can you get me through to them??
@SouthwestAir Finally! Integration w/ passbook is a great Valentine gift - better then chocoLate Flight. You do heart me.
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.
@JetBlue @vincenzolandino @CBarrows You take to me places @united simply can't...like non-stop to St. Lucia.
@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25
@VirginAmerica no A's channel this year?
@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt
@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up.
@united thank you!
@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold for customer service never us SW again
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 1357 out of sju?
@JetBlue Still love you guys. But get me to Vegas already! ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¥‚úàÔ∏èüç∏üé≤
@united Will do! Thanks!
@united flew from sdf to ATL to Tampa on Delta. Left early. Arrived early. Crew helpful. Wifi worked!!
@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
@united hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir is there any chance I could get tickets to the #DestinationDragons show in Vegas? Ive been a huge fan for years! Pretty please
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes "like every 15 minutes." Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?
@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.
@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city.
@JetBlue I cheated on you, and I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever
@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a "non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip
@united still waiting for a reply
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement üò°
@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
@AmericanAir now a delay to the rebooked flight?!
@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. üòÇüíÅ
@JetBlue thank you!
‚Äú@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè
@AmericanAir flight 2470 tomorrow, have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?
@SouthwestAir schedule is open through the end of October, got Columbus day wknd in New England for ~50K points for 4! Check your calendar!
@SouthwestAir yall have me sleeping in the airport until 4pm tomorrow! thanks
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@SouthwestAir I have followed you. Awaiting your DM.
@united not my luggage
@AmericanAir an hour at baggage carousel and still no luggage?? Nail in the coffin.
@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
@SouthwestAir doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
@SouthwestAir okay just signed up!
@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
@united Phone
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
.@JetBlue handled @0xjared's question like social media pros. Good practice for when our transportation systems are all run by friendly AIs!
@SouthwestAir - thanks to the agent boarding 1137, ATL-AUS. Left my wallet on the inbound. He found it for me!
@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ‚òÄÔ∏è&amp; races in Daytona
@SouthwestAir I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1incNCaV4n‚Äù - wow
@JetBlue OOH! Good one! Speaking of #MiAmore - Just know that #IAdore https://t.co/fWZClBvuG4 Loving #LoveSongFriday
@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, "too busy" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO
@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue in Customer Service?Who will win!For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3
@AmericanAir Mold on my flight?!? US3825 #filthyplane #hopeidonotgetsick http://t.co/zIK2UoXGnW

@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral.
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
@AmericanAir thanks!!
@SouthwestAir Sent. Thanks VP!
@JetBlue Finally taking off! LAS-FLL-SJU #letsgo

@SouthwestAir Just DMed you my confirmation number.
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@SouthwestAir For the past 2 yrs I earned A-list status thru a promo-fly 3 rnd trips in 2-3 months. How can I get that option again? #loyal
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@JetBlue loving the free #wifi and #legroom ‚úàÔ∏è #SeattleBound

@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too.
@USAirways @AmericanAir  ..off to vegas http://t.co/AygAOeB6Uu
@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
@JetBlue I can't say what airline I am on right now, but I sincerely miss you. #bestairline
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you "can't do anything" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7
@SouthwestAir @thirty_lives birthday is the 24th and he's not seeing Imagine Dragons at #DestinationDragons ?
@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs
@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï
@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@JetBlue ugh always know a way to my heart üòòüôå
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
@AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes!
@united customers ‚úÖ. Customer service ‚ùå http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
@USAirways this is ridiculous.  I have a 6:00 AM flight and two hours of rest, wasted!!!
@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I DO like your airlines, congrats! : )
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@united Now about two dozen back in line to see a single CSR for reFlight Booking Problems final leg. (Kiosks on fritz.)
@AmericanAir - cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska üòí
@united yall should probably work on that.
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@JetBlue sounds fun! How does that work?
@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic
@AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
@united could really use your help getting our bags at IAD. We're headed to YOW but now going to YXU
@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
@USAirways @jtrexsocial exactly! How? I've been disconnected 3 times!!!!
@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
@AmericanAir I'm beyond confused here. why would you offer an earlier flight?? when they Cancelled Flightled 2222, I asked for TUES. please fix!
@SouthwestAir oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks!
@JetBlue you guys rock!
@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!
@SouthwestAir thanks for your attention, I've been flying southwest for 3 years and haven't had this issue in the past.
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
@SouthwestAir flight 4040 atl to lga Cancelled Flightled any suggestions how to get home?
@AmericanAir even followed me, but I still can't get them to answer their phones. Worst. Customer "service". Ever. #customerservice #fail
@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
@VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn't exist. Emails bounce.
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time
@USAirways where's our luggage? Been waiting more than an hour! Flight 2118.
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@USAirways @AmericanAir  is there anyone answering phones today??? Listening to same damn messages for 1:10 minutes
@Sb5551 Sounds like  @USAirways should have planned better since this weather was no surprise. Completely unacceptable wait times!!!
@SouthwestAir I am in, let's do this!
@JetBlue great flight! Great view! :-) http://t.co/Yxn00pnOav
@JetBlue hi friend! Question for you when you have a moment.
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
@AmericanAir thanks so much!
.@AmericanAir Flight 654 Delayed / Flight 409 You sold my seat / flight 0671 strand me in PHX for three hours. Thanks for the memories üò°üò§üòñüò≤üò©
@united would love help getting there today. In #EWR now. Will take any airline and connections. Thx
@USAirways @shivadelrahim what about upgrades?
@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
Always have it together!!! You're welcome! RT @VirginAmerica: @jessicajaymes You're so welcome.
@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
@SouthwestAir Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you!
@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
@united I'm not sure it will have "next time"...
@SouthwestAir My DM won't go through but it is 261633561838. Please let me know if you need anything else.
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
@AmericanAir DM sent
@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost
@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the info! Have a good day.
@USAirways yes travel is complete flight 5095 from CLT to CAK Feb 18
@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
@united we need a new flight to Tucson
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
@SouthwestAir bags fly free..just not to where you're going.
@JetBlue Has DC Thinking About Summer With New Nantucket Service - @MarketWatch http://t.co/yI4wGUk5tr
@USAirways if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob
@SouthwestAir it's the poor customer service that I have a problem with!!!!!
@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off
@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done
@SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@JetBlue its domestic I just wanted more of an idea so I don't get surprised.
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@USAirways Okee doke
@united flight #1051 on 2/23. Thx
@SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
@USAirways Good grief! Flight Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold since 0400.
@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
@JetBlue Thank you.
@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW v√≠a @usatoday
@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol üòÉ
@USAirways you should update your passbook passes with any gate changes.
@JetBlue well I'm not sure I'm that bold! lol or are you saying you didn't believe me?? :P
@SouthwestAir you have no baggage tracking system?
@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.
@united I did... no response back
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
.@SouthwestAir thx for the note. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and today is all booked so had to go with another carrier. :(
@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully.
@SouthwestAir listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #RaganDisney
@SouthwestAir @DreSparkles Thank you! I finally made it to my destination
@JetBlue What's your current checked bag price policy?  I fly this coming week and couldn't find anything definitive.
@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
.@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now
@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir dont send me a tweet to cover your social media complaints. How about sending me a message with a way to resolve?!?! #CustServ
@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
@JetBlue a little vino wouldn't hurt üç∑
@AmericanAir we're still stucked in the airport. #AADelay #AA919
@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!
@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
@SouthwestAir Thank you. I know ya'll can't control the weather. I appreciate ya'll working to get my flight rebooked the last two days.
@JetBlue Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
@JetBlue Thank you!
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
@USAirways how's us 1797 looking today?
@SouthwestAir left behind iPad Air on flight 505 from Bradley to BWI, plane had already left by the time I realized. Can you possibly help?
@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@VirginAmerica that doesn't look to fat to me! It looks yummy!
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@AmericanAir Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this?
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
@USAirways the link doesn't work..

@SouthwestAir Love, love, love this. Southwest Rocks!! Always!! https://t.co/q8VSfFRd1u
@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for "maintenance" it could be the same issue 2day

@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@AmericanAir my flight out of TYR tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. How long until a rebook?
@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!

@USAirways has the worst customer service. Can't even get through to a rep you gotta be kidding me
@AmericanAir got call saying flight Cancelled Flightled but checked online and it isn't Cancelled Flightled. No where near bad weather. I have job interview
@VirginAmerica thanks! Y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry.
@SouthwestAir I was under the impression when there is an 8 hour delay in your flight because of equipment failure, compensation is offered?
@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
@USAirways last name Pordes
@USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's concern.
@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@united Had wonderful, on time flights from OGG to MSN Lost RX eyeglasses (thick) in the Admiral Club in Chicago this morning. Found?
@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.
No. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek.
@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
@JetBlue why don't you fly to #nashville? :(
@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue Hopefully now my application for JetBlue donut designer will finally go through the proper channels.
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
Yessir RT ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @yourlocalnyer Good morning, Rob. We're showing the flight to sunny Mexico just pushed off the gate.‚Äù
@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
@SouthwestAir doesn't care nor does SNA agent Jacquie Plitt, rude gal bad attitude! had 2 fly @USAirways 2 CABO thx http://t.co/VbUxfPCKfa
@AmericanAir now I have to wait "more than 60 minutes"
@USAirways Marsha M. at Myrtle Beach is the greatest! She deserves all the respect and praise there is! #ThankYouForEverything
@SouthwestAir is that the same reliable system couldn't find my info and then said it refund my credit card ?
@jetblue captain "takes as lot of muscles to frown but JUST A FEW TO SMILE. Y'all ready to go flyin?" I mean... Now I am!
@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
@JetBlue Statement on #Lufthansa Incentive Offer - Digital Journal http://t.co/GqP69g9ZGW
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@AmericanAir it doesn't allow me to hold. That's the problem.
@SouthwestAir "...you in the 10 hrs we were hanging out there? Oh, no I understand things get crazy n sometimes 10 hours isn't long enough."
@SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn't let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice
@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5
@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
@USAirways what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs
@VirginAmerica current bug on website shows ‚Äòselect departure city‚Äô when selecting destination city http://t.co/SLLYIBE2vQ
@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@united Friend at O'Hare and can't get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass.
@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?
@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.
@VirginAmerica LAX to EWR - Middle seat on a red eye. Such a noob maneuver. #sendambien #andchexmix

@SouthwestAir LOVE IMAGINE DRAGONS  SO MUCH I EOULD DIE IF I GOT TICKETS
@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#
@SouthwestAir you guys are awesome... #dontchangeathing #luv
@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
@USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit.
@JetBlue yes he and all the princesses. Trying to get to the #glassslipperchallenge at WDW.
@JetBlue Best airline name ever. Whenever I see it, I want to get on their plane to blue skies &amp; sea. (And they DELIVER on that promise)
@USAirways me too. Me too.
@JetBlue thank you! I'm excited to fly with you for the first time.
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.

@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue
@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?

@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same
@SouthwestAir jumped the gun a little Cancelled Flighting our flights? No other airline is Cancelled Flighting out of Louisville. You're ruining my vacation.
@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly
@VirginAmerica amazing to me that we can't get any cold air from the vents. #VX358 #noair #worstflightever #roasted #SFOtoBOS
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@AmericanAir DM the locator code, thanks.
@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ‚òï‚úàüëç
@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
@united yes when I landed.
@usairways Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online?
@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
@SouthwestAir is there any way me &amp; my best friend could get tickets to #DestinationDragons ? they mean everything in the world to us.
@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off

@JetBlue thanks for a speedy flight time recovery.
@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport

@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me üò≠
@united thanks, keep up the good work
@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has
@VirginAmerica add DTW and I'm sold!

@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
@VirginAmerica pilot says we expect a choppy landing in NYC due to some gusty winds w/a temperature of about 5 degrees &amp; w/the windchill -8
@SouthwestAir oh I see what you did there! Thanks for supporting #PadresST.
@JetBlue Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
@SouthwestAir i sure hope you are able to get my bag to Memphis for tomorrow.would be nice to have some clean clothes for work.
@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
@united "Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"
@AmericanAir @pbpinftworth iPhone 6 64GB (not 6 plus)

@SouthwestAir Thanks for replying, I sen't my conf #! I love aviation and Southwest and all I wanted for my 18th was to fly SWA for the day!
@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines

@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
@USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485

@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
@united question - was given food vouchers but can't use on plane..how   come
@JetBlue Another awesome telephone experience with @JetBlue Thank you, Cory! #Greatcustomerservice‚úà‚ò∫

@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job üëç.
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@SouthwestAir I got a flight at 11:55am on Thursday but looking for something tomorrow, anything available?
@united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also.
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?

@SouthwestAir thank you!!
@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
@SouthwestAir can you follow for quick DM?
@AmericanAir Close down
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@AmericanAir @cityandsand we're trying to coordinate an airport hand-off of Nutella! #veryimportantproject
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tonight at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is it overbooked? Really don't want to be bumped!
@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
@USAirways #ShoutOut 2 Kristie(sp?) from Gate4 @ PVD today. She's a #RockStar, was a tremendous help in a tough situation. #PromoteThatGirl
@VirginAmerica what happened to Doom?!
@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better.
@JetBlue #jetblue #sofly #wish #firststari seetonight http://t.co/pyJAoayNx6
@JetBlue I just DM'd you!
@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
@united sprinted from C concourse to E and just made it. Coughed up a lung in the process but am now in CLT! Tnx!
Without notifying though? ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.
@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
@AmericanAir $90 dollar RT ticket to Chicago? Yes, Please!
@SouthwestAir Working on a piece about military discounts and am hearing you offer one. Can you give me specifics and confirm? Thank You!
@USAirways my phone has been on hold since midght  fkn 7 hrs of hold ?? Unacceptable!!!!!!!!
@AmericanAir Call me Chairman, or call me Emerald. After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer.
@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
@VirginAmerica Do you provide complimentary upgrades to first class, if there are available seats?
@SouthwestAir thank you for always going above and beyond with your customer service!!!!!! #favoriteairline #luvforSW #southwestAir
@JetBlue with the free wifi #impressive #FlyFi http://t.co/T1RYpzEBc8
@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you üòÑ
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
@USAirways I should also add the weather conditions are terrible. Expecting 18 inches of snow. Any advice?
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
@JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers "we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai" and then hanging up is not the best practice.
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@AmericanAir flight 1388 tomorrow 5:15 am, status please, thanks
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@VirginAmerica awesome. I flew yall Sat morning. Any way we can correct my bill ?
@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
@JetBlue yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can't do online. Thanks.
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureüëå
@USAirways so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving?
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch.

@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
@united define "appreciate". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback.
@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
@AmericanAir No I was not given the choice by the rep Meelan (UK AA Contact Center) to escaLate Flight to a supervisor and had to book with change
@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.
@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?

@united hey! think someone could meet me with my book when I arrive at @loganairports at 10:30? It's yes please #amypoehler. Oscar took it.
@SouthwestAir you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines.
@JetBlue I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time!
@VirginAmerica you got cheese pLate Flights too.
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday
@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your "customer service" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
@JetBlue true. Maybe. Wish I had expedited security haha
@USAirways ok thank you! Very helpful! This is why you're my favorite airline!
@VirginAmerica please add more frequency to PDX Portland
@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail
@USAirways seriously!!!  Flight Cancelled Flighted. Auto rebooked to Tuesday??? Then 3hr 26min on hold for nothing. Renting car. Want refund!!!!
@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
@JetBlue I am But Your customer service is Brutal.
@USAirways My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather
@SouthwestAir almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
@USAirways there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO internet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email?
@SouthwestAir just sent you a DM w/ additonal info
@USAirways @AmericanAir just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924
@SouthwestAir @TMadCLE Flying with you in April, first time on southwest. Can't wait!!! Flew American airlines last time. Was meh.
@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled out of BNA.... Do I have to reschedule now or can travel funds be put back into my account for future use?
@AmericanAir you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse
@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus
@JetBlue yup 33036 feet. But no selfie.
@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
@united let me assure you my travel time is 4h2m not 5h2m #timezones #accuratetraveltimes #3rdtimethishashappened http://t.co/e0C9bI09cf
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
@SouthwestAir @PoteetTJ had to fly @Delta MCO-&gt;CMH for $400 b/c we cldnt reach SWA to reroute SWA 3104 Cancelled Flightlation. Voucher wld help.
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
.@SouthwestAir she needs a wheelchair at the gate for sure. What options does she have?
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@Jetblue I'm so sorry I cheated on you with @Delta @DeltaAssist. Please take me back. I wore protection.
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@SouthwestAir I'm stuck in Fort Lauderdale.
@JetBlue love traveling with Jetblue. Cant wait to go to Paris oui oui!!! NYC was awesomeee!
@SouthwestAir how many left?! I'm 15 min wway
@AmericanAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24?
@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir me not to be able to rebook another flight. Drove to ATL to catch a flight.... Was charged $40 just to get the a group I had
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@USAirways Would you guys please send service agents to gate B15 in Philly?  All the people missed there connections and there's only 2.
@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
@SouthwestAir Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@united I sent you a dm hours ago
@VirginAmerica yes, nearly every time I fly VX this ‚Äúear worm‚Äù won‚Äôt go away :)
@united it was very comfortable, now waiting for our luggage
@SouthwestAir Thanks so much. Appreciate your kindness in adjusting our reservation. Even during snowstorms, I still prefer Southwest. üëç
@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :(
@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive
@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke
@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc
@SouthwestAir really appreciate the follow up, I always fly with y'all for a reason!
@VirginAmerica Adds Pillows Instead of Lie-Flat Seats in First Class Arms Race http://t.co/SfjDuahx9Z by @skift

@USAirways Thanks to the friendly US Airways staff that helped me get booked on various flights to get home today.  Almost there!
@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized

@VirginAmerica Atlantic ploughs a lone furrow in the #MiddleEast http://t.co/DCoBoKN7EE @TheNationalUAE
@VirginAmerica Only thing I see on passbook is Virgin Mobile Mexico. How do I integrate?
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can‚Äôt get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
@AmericanAir I did twice.got a letter back saying that your company "doesn't issue refunds for phone bills" help!phone will be shut off
@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
@united They finally gave in a let him on. After they threatened to send him back to Vegas on coach. Thnx.
@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable.
@AmericanAir my boss is :)
@USAirways Need help with a flight. Weather + funeral = tough combination. On hold for over an hour. Please?
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@JetBlue thank you. Just sent msg.
@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow.
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@USAirways thanks to you, you have now incurred us approximately 2000 dollars in fees due to a staff members screw up.  #neveragain
@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush.
@SouthwestAir can you follow and we'll proceed?
@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
@JetBlue haha no need to apologize üòÅ I'll be Flight Booking Problems sooner than Late Flightr. I love JetBlue
@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.

@SouthwestAir For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite
@USAirways spent 1.5 hours in line trying to get on a flight home tonight only for it to be Cancelled Flightled an hour Late Flightr. Not even snowing at DCA
@AmericanAir @Active_Aly thx. We have already been on the iberia website, and seat reservation is unavailable. Hopefully we can call them.

@AmericanAir Thanks but don't understand why they couldn't have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable
@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
@SouthwestAir Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back.
@AmericanAir Flt Cancelled Flighted, rescheduled to bad time. Tried 800# 3hrs. Website states can't do online=useless website. Help?

@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
@SouthwestAir Incredible view! I had a smooth flight both ways even tho there was turbulence. Your pilots ROCK! http://t.co/3nsUSfSBPv

@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip.
@united what do you have in mind?
@AmericanAir Nah, just horrible dining options outside of club. Luckily Manuel in the Admirals can make a Bloody Mary.
@SouthwestAir landing early morning @BWI_Airport after snowfall. http://t.co/apRZsPxigE
@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@USAirways no word on delay reasons @LGB but Twitter is aflame with flight tracking computer crash. Rumors. True or Not?
@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
@AmericanAir five times at last count
@USAirways But every time I call I'm on hold for 45 min and then get disconnected. Any way someone can help?
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled from Laguardia to Louisville Ky and i am  stuck at the airport. Do you guys compensate for this?
@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you :)
@SouthwestAir your phone lines suck. I have a dilemma.
@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays üò° #justwantmybed
@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
@USAirways will you hold #475 today for connecting passengers coming from delayed flights?
@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@SouthwestAir- I called @united and they solved the flight Cancelled Flightlation issue in 15minutes. May be ask them how to do it? #getmorehands
@JetBlue Thanks for the reminder of a few older flights I'd taken and the easy access to add points to my new JB account! Awesome service.
@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
@united I'll be calling tomorrow
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@united Please stall flight 1535 out of ORD. I have to get to SNA tonight.
@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah, GA
@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
@JetBlue will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations
@USAirways Yes. Confirmation number and all.
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
Need more info on that! @united: @momsgoodeats We have great amenity kits. PJ's not included. We status match AA. ^KP‚Äù

@JetBlue I can't pay 30 bucks xD
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@JetBlue yes Party is Over üòÇ
@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
@USAirways -- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
@USAirways @AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine. I'm flying on one right this minute
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@USAirways flight to Des Moines Cancelled Flightled. Unacceptable to be booked on flight on Tuesday because of work commitments. 2hrs on hold
@USAirways can I get a beer please. Flight #1715
@AmericanAir now you change my gate and don't tell me? What the fuck is wrong with you people. Learn to do your fucken job
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
@SouthwestAir reference #: 261093929756
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
@united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi.
@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel üéâüéâüéâ
@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
@AmericanAir Hi guys checking in US/AA 639 JFK PHX and renewed Admirals Club today.
@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
@SouthwestAir already booked my tickets for August 20th-30th!  Can't wait for my vacation!
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE

@SouthwestAir thanks do yall expect to be operational tomorrow out of Nashville?
@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!
@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united I6EP18
@JetBlue @WSJ #JETBLUE treated me right as a #disabledtraveler thanks for a no hassle flight to @jamaica
@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
@AmericanAir leaving over 20 minutes Late Flight. No warnings or communication until we were 15 minutes Late Flight. That's called shitty customer svc
@AmericanAir Joanna is wonderful, new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! Thank You!
@united I will thank you!
@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
@USAirways what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA
@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but "by" means "within the extent or period of; during" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary
@USAirways is there a phone number or email address to customer service?
@SouthwestAir @challemann flying to LGA in the dead of winter? #jvstatus EWR &amp; JFK is always the intelligent option.
@USAirways PLEASE HELP need our plane to wait to go to #ELMIRA on Tarmac over an hr baggage took 45 and still not here thru customs
@USAirways is alright with me. Please give Scott F at BDL a bonus for excellent customer service
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
@AmericanAir check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn http://t.co/Uq2ooPjPwg
@AmericanAir is flight 2413 to LA delayed?
@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
@united I will. Thanks.
@AmericanAir that's what is on my ticket and my confirmation email. Anything else?
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today
@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out.
@AmericanAir do you guys have another flight for today that you can book me on from laguardia to louisville ky?
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed
@AmericanAir thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket
@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
@SouthwestAir luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I'm going to get spoiled.
@SouthwestAir is hosting an @TheAcademy party in the terminal in Atlanta. #peanutsonaplatter
@united thanks for moving my dad on to my my mom's flight. You helped make his birthday start with #FriendlyFriday Awesomeness! 4 paws up!
@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@VirginAmerica it‚Äôs just a bug report, guys
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@virginamerica #flight home to #dc #sunset #globe in' #backtowinter back to #work! #refreshed http://t.co/VX9vBCTdLf
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
@USAirways always fun to get screwed out of an earlier flight (that isn't full) #crummyservice #whydidntiflysouthwest #goodluckamericanair
@JetBlue Awesome! Thank you! ;)
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.

@SouthwestAir if I am a rapid awards member, does my points apply after I have taken my round trip?

@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u.
@JetBlue Yup. MCO. 82¬∞!!
@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me
@SouthwestAir is there a link to a site that displays any delays or Cancelled Flightations of flights to and from @DallasLoveField?
@JetBlue thanks to Julian at login for getting me onto an earlier flight back to DCA
@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK

@VirginAmerica Thanks for making my flight from LAX to JFK a nightmare by forcing me to check my carry on bag at the gate. (1)
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
@USAirways : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail
@JetBlue Thanks for having us hang out at Tampa Airport forever today!!! It's really been an awesome experience
@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.

@AmericanAir got off the phone w/ rep now flight has disappeared. Locator IRRLCD she said I was rescheduled. Help please.
@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@USAirways 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.
@SouthwestAir : thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
@AmericanAir thank you, truly appreciate the help, just sent a DM
@AmericanAir Just took off. Sitting with someone who is scheduled on Buenos ares out of JFK,not sre if he will make it. R thy holding plane?
@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
Hey @AmericanAir why automated call me and then hang up at 4:45 am!?! And why can't I reschedule Cancelled Flighted flights via web!?! Come on!!!
üòé RT @VirginAmerica: You‚Äôve met your match. Got status on another airline? Upgrade (+restr): http://t.co/RHKaMx9VF5. http://t.co/PYalebgkJt

@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@SouthwestAir go south everyone
@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@USAirways @AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail
@VirginAmerica is the website down?
um wut ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/M4UWcPxtXJ‚Äù
@AmericanAir Orbitz has only shown "priority" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago.
@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
@united unless it's on you guys, im good.
Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?‚Äù
@AmericanAir I need to know what to do? My flight has been Cancelled Flightled and I can't speak to anyone. Help!
@JetBlue Flight 1951. Bags haven't come and we landed 30 minutes ago.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
@VirginAmerica, you're doing a great job adding little luxuries/aesthetics that improve the air travel experience. Thank you. Keep it up!
@JetBlue Has D.C. Thinking About Summer With New Nantucket Service - SYS-CON Media (PR) http://t.co/ZoFWLdQXbe
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@JetBlue thank you! I know the weather in #Boston isn't great. Everyone's tired
@JetBlue I do follow you!
@AmericanAir I get &amp; can appreciate that. I've just had so many problems in the last year flying with guys... Pretty aggravating.
@JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed "to mail written letter" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@SouthwestAir hire more customer service agents. And hour and a half is too long to hold
@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?
@SouthwestAir @MichaelBColeman - thanks for making new direct flight to San Francisco.
That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t
@USAirways stuck on the ramp at DCA, US Air computer system crashed...everywhere.
@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
@USAirways They charged me for a flight they Cancelled Flightled, unbelievable and unheard of
@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@SouthwestAir no worries. We got thru eventually. I was just curious. Best of luck to you dealing with the weather!
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@united done
@AmericanAir don't see response!
@JetBlue It was fabulous! Very pleased.
@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@AmericanAir By "answering as fast as they can", you mean hanging up on every call?
@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz would have been a rough trip but LUCKILY we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work.
@SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. üòî why...so... few...direct...flights?
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@usairways 3rd time cut off after 10+ minutes on hold with Chairmans desk?!??? Wth how are we supposed to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?!?!?
@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?
@SouthwestAir I am following you now. I don't think I can DM until you follow me.
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
@USAirways If I am traveling with an infant in my lap, is there anything I need to do to notify you?

@SouthwestAir yall say flt 4200 is on time, yet we haven't boarded for a 3:35 departure b/c we are waiting on a new crew. Why the subterfuge
@SouthwestAir Flight 3267 (N659SW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @MitchellAirport http://t.co/LJ2YdKoR8q
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
@united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service.
@USAirways I totally understand the weather. Just frustrated. Thanks!
@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind

@USAirways your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude!
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
@JetBlue where's my selfie?
@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
@united Been on hold on the phone for well over half an hour, waiting to make a reservation change I *wanted* to make online. Help!

@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!
@USAirways please have your people hold flight 599 from Phoenix to San Jose.  We pulling up to the gate! Scheduled to depart at 5:40
@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?
@JetBlue ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm
@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy

@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
@united I guess you have to "follow" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send.
@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM.
@AmericanAir I did
@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher...
@SouthwestAir @CallMeStanley7 And bring back the "Agent will call you back..." feature. Why was that ever discontinued???

@SouthwestAir sure thing
@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
@SouthwestAir   Are flights going into Dallas this morning?   Thanks

@AmericanAir Are you expecting delays/Cancelled Flightlations at Dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? Nothing like Monday I hope!
@USAirways who do I contact about my awful experience I had 2/15/15 with @USAirways Flight 713 BUF-CLT?
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?
@VirginAmerica Congrats VX on the new route! ‚úàÔ∏èüéâ
@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill
@AmericanAir drop me a follow I need help
@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
@VirginAmerica Many Thanks for the Follow.#ourprincess #freyasfund #USA #Bandie Looking for Any Helpüòçüíóüá¨üáßüíóüá∫üá∏üíóüéÄüåèüéÄ http://t.co/UJfS9Zi6kd
@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
@SouthwestAir can't DM you without you following me...
@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@SouthwestAir my flight continues through to Vegas after my stop. Don't be upset if a stowaway.
@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.
@JetBlue thank you. Appreciate that!!
@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
@united please tell me I'm going to make my connecting flight from O'hare to #STL #SouthBendINWhere üôè http://t.co/qGwK10dEwv
@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, "because I told you to!" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!
@USAirways 3rd connecting flight delayed but still cannot make it &amp; still unable to speak to a real person
@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBaONx9txD‚Äù
@JetBlue thank you for help and quick response
@SouthwestAir I will be writing in about the service via email. My company also transports well over 100 clients monthly via SW.
@USAirways Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change
@USAirways Frustrating days!No flights home, changed airlines. Thank you PHL USAirway employees &amp; @united for help getting me back to IAH.
@united It appears there are six flights to Calgary tomorrow is this correct?
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
@unitedYou really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem, but wait for luggage for 4 hours?? IT MUST BE DELIVERED!!
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@USAirways Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now.
@AmericanAir Such a suprise! New vanity kit set for frequent travellers üòÄ thank you AA! http://t.co/fA7Nygn1Ux
@united We invite to Fallow @HelacoHLC learn about our activities.Prevention Programs of Health by Condom-Rito Family.We R 501(C)(3)Thanks
@USAirways - on hold 45 minutes trying to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight. Really?
@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked.
@JetBlue something they're not telling us (2)
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@USAirways big problem!!! Fll to clt then got off on clt but my fly to gso is Cancelled Flightled had to rent a car to get to my pops funeral
@SouthwestAir standing in Las Vegas and our flight says on time, but reps are telling us that all flights to Denver are Cancelled Flightled. HELP
@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?
@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
@united FAIL set to song. http://t.co/Axpn28xiQB "United Breaks Guitars" &lt; LMAO!
@AmericanAir my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning.
@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
@JetBlue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh!
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@SouthwestAir  Wish you allowed http://t.co/0pDNtGBXC6 to access you site for awards tracking.
@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines on approach to mex.... http://t.co/se57dmjHiW
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@USAirways us2118My wife in Boston says no snow right now.

@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week.
@SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
@USAirways I forgot my password and I don't know if my username is correct, and i want to use my miles, what i have to do??
@VirginAmerica Thanks!
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
@AmericanAir 20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend

@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??

@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
@SouthwestAir @Matt_e_Boss how long did you have to hold? We waited 35 minutes and gave up
@SouthwestAir only 1 guest needs to change a flight on a reservation of 2. How can I do it? I NEED this to happen. Say it can...Please help!
@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@SouthwestAir Guys, we've got to do something about the inability to check in online for international  flight that has... (1/2)
@AmericanAir this receipt doesn't show the evoucher value nor does it mention having used an evoucher

@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
@USAirways trying 2 fly frm DCA to SRQ to visit a family member in hospice but 4532 was Cancelled Flightled, can someone assist me?
@SouthwestAir Rapid Rewards program sold me short. #Lasttweetaboutthis but still #disappointed.
@USAirways instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to change a family vacation due to Measles outbreak and haven't been able to get anyone on the phone. Any help?
@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them.

@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again
@VirginAmerica Comenity Bank is a joke!  Please change.  Nothing but constant problems with this bank
@USAirways Mellani B. and whole team in Columbia SC are absolute superstars. Incredibly helpful.

@USAirways so you strand my bag in Philly last Sat and strand me in Philly this Sat. thanks for the bullshit.
@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
@AmericanAir still no reply to my email sent on 11th February. Even sent an email asking for acknowledgment that's it been recieved, nothing
@SouthwestAir WTF, my flight was delayed and then I go to board and my boarding pass has disappeared from the Southwest app!
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there‚Äôs no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@SouthwestAir So far so good! http://t.co/16c9ex79Rk
@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
@JetBlue any chance you will by this summer?
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
@SouthwestAir sent DM
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@USAirways res went under her maiden name...married 50...no docs with maiden name.  Hence, problem.
@AmericanAir I booked it on US Airways site. Don't see a Cancelled Flight link :(
@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,
@SouthwestAir can you update me on the emergency landing in Jacksonville right now? #parentsonboard
@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
@SouthwestAir CEO Gary Kelly, "We are America's most loved and most flown airline!" #SouthwestRally #BWI #bestemployees #swaculture #swapic
@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again.
@JetBlue please get service started at @triflight and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
@SouthwestAir Jackpot!  #legroom http://t.co/ZO2iceG4lI
@SouthwestAir thank you :-)
@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson omg!  Wish I had a flight today!  Haha there's always next time!  Have fun at #LFT5
@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@AmericanAir TY! But, their site says " Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ..."
@SouthwestAir if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you
@JetBlue glad you like it. Feel free to steal it.
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
@United, will you fill it? Yes they will. Thanks! #BringYourOwn, @kleankanteen http://t.co/daaa0rqBXW
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@JetBlue Maybe I'll just go to Cleveland instead.
@JetBlue I'm on flt 700 lax to FLL both ppl are sleeping so Id rather not disturb in flight. Tried to dl movie no go http://t.co/Nh2i9ZlzMk
@united Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew, service on both legs. THANKS
@VirginAmerica cool picture of another VirginAmerica plane off our wing. What a site! http://t.co/5B2agFd8c4
@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR üÜñ
@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss.
@united I see you coming to get me and @AggieMensGolf in Hawaii! #12thMan http://t.co/G8DKa3Edhf
@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@JetBlue #FlyingItForward I'd fly to Port au Prince, Haiti to help with the on-going earthquake relief efforts. Still lots to do there!
@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx
@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@united no thanks
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
@USAirways Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt
@AmericanAir was hoping for 8A if possible, for some frozen views along the way!
@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that
@SouthwestAir 2 hrs to put a tag on my bag sayin it should go to greenville instead of Raleigh?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
@JetBlue was just at T5 a little over a month ago. @JetBlue you guys are great thanks for everything!
Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@JetBlue has screwed me over for the last time.  @SouthwestAir, glad to give you my business. #JetScrew #AwfulCustomerService
@JetBlue I'm not sure if you can do anything to help me with that, but if you can that'd be great.
@SouthwestAir Conf #8Q6MFD Finally got through &amp; told the flight was completely booked.  That would have been better info than advise 2 call
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
@SouthwestAir I love this airline so much! Thanks so much! The service is great! The snacks are amazing! Everything is outstanding thanks!!
@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
@SouthwestAir Well plane arrived pretty much on time and it's 68 degrees on the ground in Texas. Not much to complain about.
@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
Why? üòí RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/I7Ut2ZvHCO
@SouthwestAir you know I ‚ù§Ô∏èyou but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
@USAirways epic fail @ CLT ystrdy w/Cancelled Flightled flights. No staff, no communication &amp; no refund for unused portion of tix. Keep it classy guys
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@united Another unfortunate case of bad luck, usually maintenance issue. They are now swapping planes to ONT, will get in Late Flight. :(
@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
@SouthwestAir is there anything I can do to get tickets for @Imaginedragons at @VinylVegas? It would mean so much to me #DestinationDragons
Alright... Someone has to stop this! RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lchVJoliDg
@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
@SouthwestAir I have been in contact and know there are changes but it's a destination you should really evaluate! Thanks
@SouthwestAir I need some help with a reservation
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
@USAirways so far no call back
@AmericanAir your planes made me miss 2 connections in 2 days. Thanks for nothing
@USAirways claims flight Cancelled Flighted due to weather at destination but Delta has not Cancelled Flighted flight on same route.
@AmericanAir @pbpinftworth iPhone 6 64GB (not 6 plus)
@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!
@SouthwestAir a week after Valentines day..not feeling the #LUV. Going on 11 hrs @BWI and don't my bags aren't even coming w me.
@jetblue thanks
@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 ("uplink prob"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?
@SouthwestAir Looking forward to flying once again with #SWA on Friday! The #LUV airline. #DTW #MDW #TUS
@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogot√°-Houston?
@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
@USAirways ...these changes as well to Late Flightr find out that the flight I was scheduled for isn't ready
@SouthwestAir had to be stuck in the middle seat :( http://t.co/dzeGAPfqw1
@united thank you.
@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
@USAirways I did they are busy
@VirginAmerica I emailed your customer service team. Let me know if you need the tracking number.
@JetBlue ok should I start looking into other flights?
@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
@USAirways thank you!
@SouthwestAir The pilots&amp; crew on flt 3999 and customer service professionals at baggage claim are OUTSTANDING!! Thank you!!

@USAirways Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@SouthwestAir How do I enter passport information on an existing reservation before check in?
@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
@SouthwestAir yes please
@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????
@USAirways Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn't get her name but she was great!
@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
@JetBlue Kudos to JetBlue social media team for jumping in an helping me out during the last snow storm while web site was down..Thanks!!
@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
@SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@JetBlue awe you guys are great can't wait to travel with you again soon!!!
@USAirways @AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag
@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
@USAirways was on hd for 1hr and 3min at 3:00am since my flgt  from DCA to MSY was Cancelled Flightled, still trying to get out. On hold now 50minssss
@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
@SouthwestAir loving the new planes and the lighting, only wish windows were larger. http://t.co/h44uJ63CJG

Who did this?!?!‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/kHZrCCyp2A‚Äù
@SouthwestAir I wish i would've seen this 4 hours ago!!! I WANTED TO SEE THEM TONIGHT SO BAD!!!! #CRYING
@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
@USAirways @msscottwg  "That's unusual" means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, reFlight Booking Problems online has not worked, on my second round of hold (3 hrs now). Any other options?
@SouthwestAir I think that flight was supposed to go to Houston as well, in case someone could check that?
@SouthwestAir tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it.
@VirginAmerica are you ready!? Let's say it together.. 'Noooo turbulence today!' üòò
@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!
@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
@SouthwestAir I just sent a screen shot of the incident report.
@VirginAmerica How can I watch the #Oscars2015 on my JFK-&gt;SFO flight?
@SouthwestAir Where should I fly by May 3rd? Plz advise.
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW.
@USAirways conf number FMJTYL delayed - any chance of getting an earlier flight fll to phx?

@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?
@united in fact he received my boarding pass
@united did your super computer üí© ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
@AmericanAir Didn't really need anything. Saw your mentions are often negative. Keep up the good work. #gratitude  üá∫üá∏‚úàÔ∏è

@SouthwestAir you guys are so clever üòÉ http://t.co/qn5odUGFqK
@southwestair Hi, how do I add a flight to my account? Just created it
@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
@USAirways I think it's ok.
@USAirways If I‚Äôm unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight?
@SouthwestAir Having some trouble checking in. Can you please add me so I can DM you
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the tip!
@JetBlue Worked now, ty
@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks.
@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
@SouthwestAir can't checkin online for 2:00 flight tmrw fr. Cancun. "Undefined error" &amp; 800# not working.Family of 4 don't want Cgroup! Help
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW‚Äù I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail

@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
@SouthwestAir so happy that you can finally put your #southwestairlines boarding pass into passbook! Makes life so much easier ‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir what's the best number to use?
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
@SouthwestAir I'm not sure I did the messaging part right. Please let me know if you received it.
@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?
@VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
@AmericanAir thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!
@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay.
@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss lol I'm sorry I'm just seeing this now but LAUREN OH MY GOD AHHHH
@AmericanAir second pic from CDG?
@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!
@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.
@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights flights arbitrarily on same itinerary.  Weekend ruined for no good reason! No crew = missed Monday am mtg.
@SouthwestAir @Vindictive_tK Larry David works for southwest?
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@AmericanAir Have been trying to reach American Airlines since last evening to Cancelled Flight flights. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! What now???
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: #IfThe80sNeverStopped, we'd still be rocking out to this chart-topping hit". What?  The 80's are over?
@united good morning, any first class upgrades available for ua1619 Feb 25  rsw to ewr? I need 4 seats please
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
@USAirways 502 M-phx Im still on The plane waiting And waiting
@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
@JetBlue flite454
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash

@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
@SouthwestAir Seriously, is the reason for all the Cancelled Flightled flights and long phone wait times that you guys are tremendously understaffed?
@SouthwestAir thank you, someone finally answered and was able to change my flight that was Cancelled Flighted bc of ice. Thank you for response
@JetBlue thanks for bringing my son home to me.
@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service
@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines says most bags left in Miami have been returned following mechanical glitch &gt;&gt; http://t.co/Ib8kyjBCJM
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united your customer service is crap.
@united Can you transfer my bags too?
@USAirways I left my personal stuff on US4551 from PHL-BOS about an hour ago. Went baggage, was told plane left to call 800#
@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also Cancelled Flightled flights to LGA. Yet @united is flying on time to both. WTH??

@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!
@USAirways @AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them
Yall tried it. "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/62GoDFaKNB‚Äù
@united your "Airserv" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity.

@SouthwestAir Just sent DM with confirmation number and passenger name on SWA 3104 MCO-&gt;CMH
@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
@AmericanAir @emxlyy "The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear."
@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free.
@SouthwestAir we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don't get put on a flight.

@united Brandi Zabsonre in Denver deserves a raise for bringing delight into a terrible travel situation. big ups http://t.co/TK3aOpdtSQ
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.

@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
@SouthwestAir All Flights lead to VEGAS BABY!

@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating.
@SouthwestAir I DMed you :)
@VirginAmerica you suck!
@USAirways over the phone. I called the 6170 number and she picked up almost immediately.
@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°

@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!

@JetBlue No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.

@SouthwestAir thanks for the b day concert I watched them all (and noticed the fist bump/high five at the end of the "rock" version)
@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
@USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!!
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane

@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.
@virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg
@VirginAmerica  how are you gonna have a deal from Dallas to DC but no deal from DC to Dallas? #sad
@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
@JetBlue actually flight 1089 not 1098
@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@united yes, would love an upgrade or voucher,  please give me a call 9148445695
@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?
@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!
@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.
@JetBlue Airways Now Covered by Bank of America (JBLU) - Dakota Financial News http://t.co/WOwxhpU5qv
@SouthwestAir It's all good. Thanks!
@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
@united no thanks
@AmericanAir  my fly is 1579  if do you have some news
@AmericanAir no worries, loved flying with you guys. Thanks!
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ‚úàÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled flights and asshole phone support. #worstairline
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united i sure will
@SouthwestAir I would love a great deal from bwi to las Memorial Day weekend aka my bday weekend üò¨
@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
@USAirways I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@united is it on a flight now? Thanks for reply.
@JetBlue What confirmation number?
@AmericanAir Not here yet, but I plan on it. If you could have them fly low and slow right in front of me, that would be great. ;-)
@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
@SouthwestAir didn't realize no clothes until at hotel - suggestions?
@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
@SouthwestAir they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having
@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.
@SouthwestAir you are failing! Diverted, stuck and no communication! Make a decision and let us go!!!! üòûüò° flight #4229
@united I know that. Thanks for the standard reply.
@SouthwestAir #3854 ATL to RDU. Snow forecasted for Raleigh this evening.
Thank U üòò ‚Äú@JetBlue: @ItsLaLoca But of course! Safety is always 1st!  We'll make sure to handle her with CARE and LOVE!  :)‚Äù
@JetBlue update on Flight 462 would be appreciated when you have time, thanks

@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir what are your weight restrictions for carry on luggage? Can find measurements but not weight restrictions. TIA
@USAirways Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice
@JetBlue can I switch my seat for my trip on Sunday?
@SouthwestAir you're the best
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.
@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
@JetBlue its a wonderful thing!
@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
@JetBlue haha thanks Jetblueüëå‚ò∫Ô∏è
@AmericanAir @SentieriMelinda Any updates? It shouldn't take hours for assistance. I love @SouthwestAir
@JetBlue I did.... Would be nice to see more services out of @triflight instead of having to drive 3-4 hrs to like charlotte or atlanta
@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
@JetBlue I would go to Dallas to see my grand baby that I miss so much. I feel like a piece of my heart is there.
@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly
@AmericanAir checked in at Des Moines, lay over in ORD, final destination Austin, Texas.  Baggage was only checked to ORD.
@AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys
@SouthwestAir yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent.
@united no thank you
@SouthwestAir are any flights leaving DC today? Flight was Cancelled Flightled, been on hold for over an hour.

@USAirways Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there.
@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
@AmericanAir Thank You! CC: @packermama1
@USAirways you guys suck at JFK tonight -- oh this MORNING!!!
@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
@USAirways AA Gate Supervisor emplid 600117 allowed flight AA67 to leave JFK to SJ on 20feb15 w/o 8 customers that made final boarding call.
@JetBlue @hanneslohmann cool
@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@USAirways are the bags off Flight 1898 CLT to JFK? We landed last night just before midnight.
@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey
@JetBlue great trip today!  Thanks to the crew flying us home, they were fantastic! http://t.co/sk6W9XQaQB
@JetBlue I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks
@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
@VirginAmerica a lot of "apologies" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever.
@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
@AmericanAir Flight #2390 delayed 14 hours!! No one at #AmericanAirlines counter can tell my husband that he will be on that flight! Help???
@AmericanAir No, when I call AA now I can't even get on hold...can you help me?
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q16Xvwg0L6‚Äù .... I have to refrain what I want to say

@SouthwestAir Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast.
@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@SouthwestAir when will you have flight from DAL to PVD?
@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@SouthwestAir Disappointed in the FAA "regulation" you have 2 furnish proof of age 4 toddler. Thx for the unnecessary headache. #flyUnited
@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should‚Äôve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@USAirways Collectively since Friday I've been on hold with customer service for over 3 hrs. My issue is not resolved... so frustrated!
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.

@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2Paid for early bird and sat in back
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/8o3SCR5EFW‚Äù smh yall expect me to trust a childish airline with my life? #Nah
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
@USAirways our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn't fit.
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581
@JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs?
@usairways I have been on hold for over 3 hours.  Please help! http://t.co/tyXAZtMQ1U
@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.

@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@USAirways am 2. 1/2 hours from airport sure would like to talk to someone
@USAirways just now but no general announcement
@USAirways worked w/ Tiffany H at cust service desk in Charlotte and she was helpful and patient. Still stuck, but she was great.

@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@SouthwestAir @tbuccheriFRNC3E. It takes 13.5 hours to fly from Chicago to Beijing on United, and 12 to fly from Vegas to Omaha on SW...
@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.

@JetBlue üò≠ I used points can I get them back if I decide not to go?
@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
@united yes, I want to complain. Your coworker was neither. Is there a customer service point airside?
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
@SouthwestAir thanks to Ella-Mae at LAS counter for going above and beyond to help us get back to ABQ after our flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home
@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising.
@AmericanAir thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW
@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard.
@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
@USAirways Can I book award travel on Etihad with Dividend Miles?
@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?
@USAirways it's not a consolation because my bags are somewhere else, which is a real impediment to me going on a different vacation

@USAirways please help! No bags, no way to get through to customer service since 8AM this morning! Help!!
@united hi! I just bought a flight with united through ebokeers from Paris to Miami. Do I have any chance to check that everything is ok?
@JetBlue check DM please :)
@AmericanAir does it show that we are on the same plane?
@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11
@SouthwestAir just sent it
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped

@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congrats!
@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@united @laurasbrown5 What does "dealing via email" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@AmericanAir awesome flight this morning on AA3230! Awesome crew and even landed early!
@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@united  oh united, how much I despise thee!
@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call
@JetBlue When chging flight, isit possible to pay the fare difference in dollars when the ticket was bought completely via point redemption?
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@united worst service ever üòà

@VirginAmerica Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight, and they kept things entertaining
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN HoLY SHT
‚Äú@JetBlue: @benjaminokeefe Thanks for including us on your tour! Did you pack your winter coat?‚ÄùUnfortunately yes ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏è #WereNotinCaliAnymore
@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
@SouthwestAir prove it
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@SouthwestAir last week I flew from DAL to LAX. You got us in almost an hour early. Thank You.
@USAirways the call hung up on me..
.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@SouthwestAir will you ever have a nonstop from #SJC to #BNA?? We'll take #SFO or #OAK too! Pleaseeeeee thank you!
@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to "bad weather" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?
@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
@USAirways why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr?
@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
@JetBlue Just a thought!
@USAirways Don't want to clog your already-crowded line with a special meal request. Can someone DM me to sort out? #vegetarianproblems :)
@JetBlue can you tweet #closepwcs to get the word out?üò¢
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
@JetBlue Are we able to change to an Even More Space seat after we've checked in online? Have a flight tmrw and can't seem to change my seat
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@VirginAmerica I've applied more then once to be a member of the #inflight crew team...Im 100% interested. #flightattendant #dreampath -G

@SouthwestAir snow forecasted for Raleigh NC tomorrow night. Need to know if there's a plan to reschedule flights into RDU Wednesday night
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
@AmericanAir @RLDelahunty record l#oaaret got email we couldn't get rescheduled on another flight but don't know if flight is Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman

@SouthwestAir, sev ppl im my office received an apology and 2k. FF miles for this delay, only apologize to select ppl? I got nothing..
@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
@SouthwestAir is having a sale! I'm delighted!
@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons @beatsmusic I'd love to hear them live at @VelourLive @velourlive this saturday! #destinationdragons
@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags
@SouthwestAir appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers!
@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!
@SouthwestAir yeah haha. Never been in one. It's expensive üòÇüòÇ and we will!!!!! So much fun! #destinationdragons
@SouthwestAir are there any flights from MSP to HRL in March? I'm looking at 3/19-3/23
@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
@USAirways is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon.
@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?
@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks.
@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
Who Okay'd this?!?! RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/knUVuOVhub
@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
@JetBlue love you guys. You know that. But I paid for prem. wifi toplay @vainglorygame. No go. Ping terrible / up too http://t.co/CmjRIWOP7O
@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks.
@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
@SouthwestAir Amazing customer service as well. Will definitely fly with you guys again if my instrument is involved. #10/10
@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??
@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
@united have all 747-400s been updated with power outlets and seat-back TVs yet? Flying ORD to Tokyo-Narita on the 28th
@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
@JetBlue ok!!! That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll reach out if I have any other questions.
@AmericanAir Seats gvn away. 7 strangers in 2 Chicago. Rented van. Drove to toledo. No help, no offer, no hotel. http://t.co/nxQiJCoJNj
@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?
@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
@AmericanAir I wrote down the evoucher number. I got rid of the voucher when I purchased air fair
@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service
@JetBlue Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H
@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@USAirways can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them)
@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.

@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!
@USAirways I love you guys!!!
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry.
@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?
@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool
@SouthwestAir  when is the next flight with free cocktails ?
@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
@SouthwestAir thank you for your help resolving my problem Shannon ROCKS - even though Rhonda didn't !!
@united pls follow for DM.
@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass
@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
@JetBlue flight 117. proud to fly Jet Blue!
@AmericanAir thank you for quick responses.   #aa usually has fantastic customer service. That's why I was so shocked when it wasn't there
@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?
@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
@USAirways now you just hang up on me. I‚Äôm starting to think this is personal!
@SouthwestAir hilarious flight attendants on Vegas to Detroit tonight http://t.co/nw7vx7DGMF
@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@SouthwestAir Being old I will miss my connection and can sleep at OAK or get a hotel on my own dime rubs me the wrong way. I wasn‚Äôt Late Flight.
@JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue
@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)
chair #selfie "@JetBlue: @StacyCrossB6 @PHLAirport @SaharaSams  Everyone looks #FLAWLESS ;) We're so PROUD of our PHL crew! #BlueHeros‚Äù
@JetBlue *cough* #awkward!
@USAirways Thank you!
@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
@SouthwestAir can y'all develop Ding for a chrome/Firefox browser extension? That would be swell
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
@USAirways  is a bag that is   23‚ÄùL x 9‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH  allowed as a carry on?
It's on me, @JetBlue! That's not what you said last night, though... :(
@AmericanAir thank you!
@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ
@SouthwestAir On my flight today from RSW to GRR I was able to snag a free SW Agent to check for me. It looks like we are (finally) all set.
@VirginAmerica Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ACCESS TO #DestinationDragons TONIGHT AT @theTroubadour üòÅ @Imaginedragons Crying /dying rn #ripme
@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@VirginAmerica I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven't heard back. How do I get help with this?
@USAirways No one answers your reservation phone line. I need to book travel with a  companion certificate. How do I get through?!!!
@JetBlue me again :) you don't have ABC on Inflight TV, do you? (If so, what channel? #SharkTank is on!)
@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
@SouthwestAir when's the next deal going to happen a poor college student is trying to fly to Orlando instead of drive in August! Lol
@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed.
@JetBlue NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER. We've waited patiently, not to mention $150 and six months of marathon training, we need 2 be there tmrw.
@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
@USAirways - what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat?
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment
@united where is my bag?? I'm in Mexico about to go build a house &amp; my suitcase never got on my flight from CLE w me. I need it. SAN68059M
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vOUUFRN4jS‚Äù YASSS JetBlue ! Tell them !
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
@SouthwestAir I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
.@JetBlue 4 min response time. I'm impressed! I'm in. It's official.  :-) #trueblue  JetBlue gets social.
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
@SouthwestAir sure, please follow me so I can do so?
@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
@AmericanAir from a service rep but that hasn't happened yet. I'm honestly fed up and sick of this. No notice when my flight got Cancelled Flighted
@SouthwestAir wifi stays connected about the lifetime of a higgs boson
@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
@AmericanAir great customer service thanks
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/RkwugmanM9‚Äù lmao you know a white person said this
@USAirways Can you advise on what's happening with departure delays from CLT?
@SouthwestAir you are the worst airline. Congrats!!
@AmericanAir I need to rebook and I cannot get an agent. Can you help?
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.
@USAirways comedy of errors continues..." We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way" #fail
@jetblue it's time for a direct flight from #JFK to #PITT.... @ Official JetBlue Terminal 5 - New York‚Ä¶ http://t.co/QygXGmd3Sn
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
@united Will do, cheers
@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
@USAirways is it policy to tell customers "We can't help you?" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable
@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
@united what, you forgot to tell them the flight was coming... Thanks for allowing me to miss my connection
@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how "wifi is coming!" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw
@JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@AmericanAir #AmericanViewThe view of Oregon from seat 31F, flight AA1469 2/22/15 http://t.co/t9JBN9WZtq
@JetBlue I waited in line all that time to be told by a crewmember that there's no update until 9:30 #3HrDelay #disappointed
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
Lmfaooo ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1G9RnmYUQe‚Äù
@JetBlue No changes made. My son's pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue
@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest
@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back.
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
@united DCA-EWR Flight #4372
@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
@JetBlue incidentally, Sheila at JFK deserves a raise because she's awesome.
@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's "not worth it" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS
@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever.
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
@AmericanAir did that yesterday. On the phone with them now
@USAirways Thank you. I'll do that next time!
@JetBlue Received an invitation to participate in e-rewards. Is this legit from JetBlue? Just double checking bc the site looked different.
@VirginAmerica What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail
@AmericanAir Are you kidding? You don't think I've done that?? I've called dozens of times &amp; it tells me to call back &amp; hangs up.
@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!
@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?
@JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A.
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@USAirways its fine. Just wondering where my money went...
@united your website won't allow me to post the required document, i keep getting **were having technical difficulties**
@AmericanAir thanks for being entirely unhelpful and wasting hours of my time today
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@USAirways tell them to get on that, please.
@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
@USAirways now on hold for 90 minutes
@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways.
@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again.
@SouthwestAir sure can! Just a second.
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@united   sent DM last week, re: suit regarding your error. No response was given. Please Answer DM or tell me who to send suit to....
@JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don't help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for sending my kid to the #DestinationDragons concert Vegas @Imaginedragons So awesome! http://t.co/G9b6e0a2sZ
What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!
@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
@AmericanAir I have been on hold 3 hours.  2 seconds of it with a rude agent.
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i "have" to fly with you.
@SouthwestAir Flying with you in about 2 weeks, bringing blankets bc it's freezing!üòú
@USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways
@USAirways @USAirwaysCenter My lost bag lands in Hartford at 639p tonight. Will it be delivered to Danbury CT tonight?
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@VirginAmerica Thanks for a great flight from LA to Boston! Pilots did a great job landing in the snow. Can we go back to LA now? #seriously
@VirginAmerica What @dhepburn said.
@USAirways  to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is
@SouthwestAir when are you starting routes to #Hawaii and #Canada?
@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks
@SouthwestAir I've been a fan of imagine dragons since 2012 and they're my fave band and #DestinationDragons is during my bday can I get tix
@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
@SouthwestAir almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
how sway how ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tQc96tKcI9‚Äù
@VirginAmerica You have any flights flying into Boston tomorrow? I need to be home and you Cancelled Flightled my flight and didn't do anything
@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
@SouthwestAir Thank you!  #thankful #feelingtheluv
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3Ltx7JKBo9‚Äù is fleek dead yet now?
@USAirways I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP!
@SouthwestAir We have been waiting for almost 3 hours trying to rebook flights. PLEASE help us get through to someone.
Why @JetBlue let someone from black Twitter in their multimedia department?
.@united what link? Those are all the email offers u sent me in a year to buy/transfer miles.The last 1 just expired http://t.co/ZZPs5ywVE2
@SouthwestAir please expedite missing bag claim #3526665682. Thanks!
@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
@JetBlue my family and I are excited to see you tooüòäüòä
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won't let me... about to lose my business
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@AmericanAir My father loved working for you as well as PanAm
@JetBlue I did see that! Working on picking up a trip or two as we type.
@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
@AmericanAir Am I upgraded on my next flight?
@JetBlue I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE
@united As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers.
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@JetBlue I know you guys are super busy but is flight 1222 an a320 or e190?
@SouthwestAir boarding passes now compatible with #iPhone #Passbook http://t.co/1ESmMnIZEk
@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
@JetBlue, I normally ‚ù§Ô∏è you, but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway, no wifi &amp; tv not working properly
@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place.
@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
@united I'm a UA 1k. I think it's @iamtedking who was looking for help
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
@SouthwestAir Hey southwest! I wanna go to see @Imaginedragons ! You guys are a lot better then jet blue.
@USAirways message me if you want to issue a refund so someone else can use my seats tomorrow AM #flightCancelled Flighted #custservicehasnonumber
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers.
@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
.@united Thanks. Hopefully this is easily resolved.
@AmericanAir would it be possible to change my flight on your website? Many thanks
@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said "unspecified error" and to call SWA
@VirginAmerica do you have an application for iOS? Was looking and only saw Virgin Mexico :( &lt;/3
@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
@united DM ed u the request num
@united Classic
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold with customer service for over an hour. Can you help?!
@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.
@VirginAmerica Is flight 769 on it's way? Was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago. Website still shows "On Time" not "In Flight". Thanks.
@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding.
@USAirways i hate you
@JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue
@SouthwestAir Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip?
@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
@SouthwestAir That would be brighter than all the stars combined on the red carpet tonight!
@VirginAmerica all crap channels which is why I pay to watch UK tv
@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted üò¢
@JetBlue But jet blue had Cancelled Flighted my ticket &amp; never reissued it.
‚Äú@AmericanAir:  "Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.‚Äù Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@united how's my refund coming along??
@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us
@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@SouthwestAir can i get tiks for #DestinationDragons omg id love to! Plz üò±‚ù§Ô∏èim dying
@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
@united on final. Pls don't let my connection leave!!!Conf# NPBHD0 http://t.co/eWXwXiDTfX
@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb
@AmericanAir why thank you!! Yayayay!!
@JetBlue thank you very very much!! üíôüíô
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@SouthwestAir any spare tickets for Vegas? Would be forever grateful! #DestinationDragons
@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?
@AmericanAir no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday...
@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner.
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@USAirways &amp; there are seats together, they just have fees. Seems if I'm taking a 5am flight the least you can do is wave the $10.
@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
@USAirways making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL
@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes
@USAirways strikes again. @emilylyonss  I strongly suggest you live tweet your ordeal. Their media team appreciates the updates üòé
@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
@AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
@USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day
@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@AmericanAir , I was told my flights 2516 &amp; 2244 was Cancelled Flightled. But I don't seem to have any date/time changes. I've been waiting for a call
@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
@AmericanAir #epicfail on connections in #Chicago today, extremely disappointed w/ unaccommodating customer service, rethinking loyalty üòê
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@SouthwestAir my bag was Late Flight-checked and put on a different flight from OAK-&gt;MSY. Having troubles tracking it down. Any help?
@united Hopefully They will give me a feedback, bafore my flight...
@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
@JetBlue Thank you for the quick response! I am trying to request abassinet for my son. it would be great if you can help me with my request
@JetBlue thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery
@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
@united no, I have a pricey Chase Mileage Plus CC.
@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
@USAirways with the weather mess in the South, I missed my connection in CLT. Impressed though with the Cust Serv phone reps today.
@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
@SouthwestAir I know where that is! Alas I live far, far away now. #Books
@JetBlue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @VirginAtlantic is ranked higher! @VirginAtlantic here I come!
@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
@JetBlue Marks 15th Year With 'Bluemanity' Plane Design - http://t.co/E5NaxBUe4s http://t.co/KlxivnbCYh
@united #OrthoDoc on-call to in-flight! Glad to have been of service!
@SouthwestAir hey southwest! Can I see @Imaginedragons in Atlanta? My friend has never been there, loves them, and he is from Taiwan!
@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model.
@SouthwestAir ..just booked trip to Cancun...‚ù§Ô∏è no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options
@USAirways  big thank you to your ticketing agent Ute V at Dulles-Washington for OUTSTANDING guest service to get me rebooked
@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
@SouthwestAir I need your help but no one will pick up the phone.
@SouthwestAir Thanks I just sent a DM with this info.
@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell.
Thanks @JetBlue. Next up we will see how the slog from JFK to the city goes!
@united New Apple cr√¢pe, amazing! Live from UA1207. Really nice crew too.  #AmericanAir has biscuits, UA needs them 2 http://t.co/gZ9GqDT7Jj
@united can you please follow for a DM?
@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
@JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
No they didn't -.- ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/58B7swRpmq‚Äù
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
@AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife's luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice
@USAirways next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
@JetBlue - BlueManity brought tears to my eyes. JetBlue' s commitment to giving back to the crewmembers and the community is aww inspiring!
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
@USAirways what's the charge for oversize? Not overweight
LMAO Y'ALL ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/LQjT2jvOYS‚Äù
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
@USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me?
@AmericanAir excellent!  Love you guys!  If it is first class I'll hug ya'll!  See you shortly!
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@united that's a crazy long form! You need something other than a video?
@JetBlue Awww man...but I need to buy this ticket today and be home the 1st of MarchWhere do I go for this...or can you assist me ?
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports.
@JetBlue real shit my nigga north don't play around!
@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!!
@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
You don't have to do this ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/iZfofgjzUi‚Äù
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
@VirginAmerica good to be home #texas #moodlighting http://t.co/N3BVZTY3zI
@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
@USAirways  And now your half assed plane is falling apart. Some one tell my family I love them! #DoBetter http://t.co/UA6doUA34l
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@JetBlue Also, thanks for your prompt replies. I'm really impressed--and you're not just brushing me off. Much appreciated!
@JetBlue I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy
@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
@USAirways "Able"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?
@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
@united yes I have
@USAirways "admirals club" at CLT has rude, and ignorant front desk staff...@AmericanAir you have fallen so far...THANKS DOUG PARKER!!!
@USAirways  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!
@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
@SouthwestAir and now our arrival is delayed nearly 5hours. Yeah an entire day in an airport is not my idea of a stress less vacation #fail
@USAirways I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you
@JetBlue would a storage container like this green one be acceptable to check in with luggage? 18Gal totes http://t.co/mJtK2SFuhG
@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
@SouthwestAir but if my bag makes it with me to Greenville tonight then all is forgiven. #HighHopes
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@SouthwestAir thank you!!! #bringbacktheluvtordu #miami #directflights
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-------- do not reply to emails?
@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after
@USAirways btw, not upset at usaiways, promise.
@SouthwestAir you cx'ed almost the entire east coast flights All other planes are taking off any traveling fine I need to get to Nev ASAP
@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.

@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
@JetBlue how much for a trip to a warm island @SamChampion http://t.co/N3SUIip0VW
@SouthwestAir injured at check in yesterday. U told me to go to dr. on hold with SWA for over hour trying to talk with someone. suggestions?
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@USAirways any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@SouthwestAir what is DM?
@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?
@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was "frozen"! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver
@united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ??
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?
@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
@JetBlue Thank you ! What about Paris ? Could we arrange something from there ?
@SouthwestAir I am but it says yall are sold out. Me &amp; My coworkers would need to get out first available
@VirginAmerica you know what would be amazingly awesome? BOS-FLL PLEASE!!!!!!! I want to fly with only you.
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
@JetBlue I will. I love flying with you all. Great service.
@USAirways Thx to gate agt John Pascucci for finding us a flight from CLT to PVD after our original one was Cancelled Flightled http://t.co/YiwLhQhZgp
@JetBlue lord...
@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help
@AmericanAir Last thing I want to deal w/ before 8 on a Mon! I've already waited the suggested wait time, so I hope I get a call back ASAP.
@USAirways OK we are on DAY 11 trying to  book a flight for 4.  Ur system STILL says "due to weather‚Ä¶.call back Late Flightr"  #outofbusiness ?
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
@united can you send me another confirmation email?
@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
@VirginAmerica wish I can afford to fly with you next Friday  going back home.. love everything  about your airline
@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?
Lol, k. ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/IUX94Rgc83‚Äù
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Confirmation number just DMed. Appreciate any help!
@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue.
@USAirways thanks for three Cancelled Flightled flight and making us go from raleigh to charlote to lexington to philly. istead of raleigh to philly
@JetBlue, flights 1970, 1366, and 1552 will fly over after 1 am on your way into @BostonLogan - mind taking ocean approach so we can sleep?
@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned "confirmed" certificates?
@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
@SouthwestAir thanks. What's your opinion on chances of getting in okay tomorrow?
@united lets see of we can do this today! Hoping for an on-time dept #dullestostatecollege #runningonthreehoursofsleep #delayedovernight
@JetBlue Apparently the pilot had made some announcement about engine trouble and losing fuel too quickly.
@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
@JetBlue client is asking if kids need their own email addresses to get TB acct. Is this true?
@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta
@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï
@JetBlue Learning about your awesome twitter management today in my Social Media Marketing class! keep up the good work! @SXU @PhD_Mama_
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
@USAirways And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail
@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
@SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight..
@USAirways thanks so much!
@united did not get names...Dallas flight and Chicago
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
@AmericanAir Thanks for doing that but now it's telling me to go to the airport and check in with an agent-what's up? http://t.co/PfseNJk5Pw
@united flt 1583 EWR to SFO excellent service. Friendly flight attendants. made the 6AM flight a very good start to the day.
@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it.
@USAirways No flights out of Philly because of system wide tech issue.   @CBSPhilly
@VirginAmerica is there special assistance if I travel alone w/2 kids and 1 infant? Priority boarding?
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on.
@JetBlue what's good with a Miami terminal?
@USAirways Thank you for your help today.  I have been a loyal US airways customer and i appreciate your responding to my tweets.
@SouthwestAir can you outline the policies for both scenarios?
@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation.
@united yes, David Allan send an email with this number (KMM24999563V99860L0KM) and case#8719519
@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1
@JetBlue Please come to Indianapolis!
@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
@united sucks.
@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
@JetBlue Thank you for the service credit. And to @PamGrout for positive thoughts.
@united you need to follow me so I can dm you to give you the info
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@AmericanAir check your DM please
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/h6cE3mWCqj
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@JetBlue #ClosePWCS please just tweet thisüôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è I fly jetblue every time btwüòè
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
@JetBlue 's free wifi on board is the best thing that's happened since sliced bread
@SouthwestAir Hi! I just saw a Black History month commercial on TV &amp; Im excited! In support of this month,will you all grant me 1 free trip
@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
@USAirways do you know what flight the pilots for 1581 are coming in on? Thanks.
@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
@USAirways Thanks!
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to "weather" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent.
@united @HiltonWorldwide @Caravannyc @MaysvilleNYC Let's go! Join me on my first trip back to NYC‚Ä¶as a tourist: http://t.co/egaEjtRGLb
@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
@VirginAmerica Your planes are really pretty. Just thought u should know that. :)
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@USAirways i will be on this plane while on the ground longer than i will be in the air. US5235
@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight
@USAirways  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@united we are the airline that has Cancelled Flightled flights TOMORROW to the NYC area
@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear
@JetBlue ripped my suitcase. I then was yelled at with attitude from Geraldine, your employee at the baggage center.Worst airline= #jetblue
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@VirginAmerica I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?
@SouthwestAir MY BAGS ARE. 1st woman said it would be there on the next flight... not there, so now Ive got nothing. Big wigs help me out
@AmericanAir is AA951 to S√£o Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
@AmericanAir Still looking as we speak.
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
@united next day
@SouthwestAir no one I call knows anything about it so I'm just wondering how to get any? #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue of course I am!!‚úàÔ∏è
@USAirways Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp; counting..
@USAirways: u didn't bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats!
@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@united is the worst http://t.co/27aitZl6nd
@SouthwestAir first time flying with you. You've definitely won me over!
@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn‚Äôt a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
@SouthwestAir Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter? thanks you.
@USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice
@SouthwestAir my sister&amp;brother in law need to get to Florida desperately flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.
@JetBlue That's right! :) Game, set, match.
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.‚Äù#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset
@USAirways  well its 11:45am and just got an email that my 11am flight is delayed-thats not right
@SouthwestAir are you guys alive? i've been on hold for 25 minutes and counting.....
@SouthwestAir hey I'm flying from Tampa to Denver today and I want to know if there will be tv's in the seats like @JetBlue
@SouthwestAir We need help changing a name on a company reservation....We tried calling customer relations but there is a busy signal.
@southwestair. So important to accept others for who they are. #SWADiversity
@SouthwestAir you guys should stop doing service in Denver it's horrible I get stuck here every time! I've been here almost 24hrs
@SouthwestAir constantly providing wonderful views and service! #SouthwestLuv http://t.co/9UNxqOTzIK
@united message sent. Thank you!
@AmericanAir - Can you please give me a travel agent support phone number? I cant find it on your website. Thanks.
@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boardedOnly 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding
‚Äú@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP‚Äù the service just hasn't been great.
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people.
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
@JetBlue Late Flight again lost almost 3 hours of my bay area weekend not to mention two hours of unnecessary vacation time from work.  #flt348
@USAirways Sitting in a cesspool of germs on the ground in #PHL for 2 hours now.
@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?
@AmericanAir I have got a flight forThe next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit
@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas üòâ
@JetBlue we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
@JetBlue I can't. I don't have acces to a phone rn. My iPhone broke. :/ would rather change it now then Late Flightr.
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@USAirways how does it feel to have almost everyone hate you?
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation,helpful representatives &amp; a comfortable flying experience
@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues.
@united ...and when that doesn't work...
@USAirways i worked with you and bought my own rental car when you failed to get me to the location i paid to get to and now....
@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together
@SouthwestAir knows whats up! That #BlackHistoryMonth commercial. Just another thing to add to reasons why I fly with #SouthWestAirlines
@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@SouthwestAir @livvyports16 and I became best friends Bcuz of @Imaginedragons is there any other way?
@USAirways Your "moveup" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
@united U blow
@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
C'mon, this is worse than JetBae. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. https://t.co/yZXfe7au22
@USAirways what is the expected wait time to speak to someone via 800 number?
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@SouthwestAir what's yall corporate number bc yall are not trying to accommodate me at all!!!
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
,@USAirways 2nd time this occurred in 3 weeks. I'm not patient. I have no choice.  #Antitrust issue
@SouthwestAir can you please DM me who I can speak with regarding my receipts and who I can email a presidential level complaint
@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united üëç
@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
@united I got an email from cust. care for an issue I had offering me a voucher. How do I claim that? I emailed back but got no reply. DM me
@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
@SouthwestAir been waiting for 70 minutes on hold because yall Cancelled Flightled my return flight. Answer the phone!!!
@united obviously
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
.@USAirways It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area.  Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing.
@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@AmericanAir trying to get home is beyond complicated. It's should not be this hard. Students are split up and we will not fly AA ever again
@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.
@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?
@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@USAirways my in-laws flight Cancelled Flighted 4 tonight. U auto rebooked 4 flight on Tuesday that doesn't work. Can you help reFlight Booking Problems them?
@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!
Thanks! Hope I don't look like a complainer, I've written of good experiences w/you in the past and am making do in terminal 5 :) @JetBlue
@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS
@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
@SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?
@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/FFc13zYGJS
@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
@AmericanAir Late Flight from phoenix, gave ticks away when arrived chicago, held bags hostage chicago, rented van drove to toledo. 5 hr drive.

@JetBlue Hi there, any rough idea of when January 2016 flights will be made available?
@SouthwestAir yes please
@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@SouthwestAir /I really love your customer service Lou Ann in Phx rocks. Thanks SW. #be Ourguest
@JetBlue sure is üíô
@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@SouthwestAir Sure was,  with @Delta  looks like I'll make my birthday celebration after all.
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange.
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@USAirways I tried calling for yet another delayed flight and was told the phone line couldn't handle the volume and was hung up on. Twice.
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
@JetBlue I definitely will. Thanks!
@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
@USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min
@USAirways this is my 2nd attempt to call US airways dividend miles, 52 minutes no help hung up - #usairways #BS http://t.co/GiEnNyqN22
@SouthwestAir what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl?
@VirginAmerica plz help me win my bid upgrade for my flight 2/27 LAX---&gt;SEA!!!  üç∑üëçüí∫‚úàÔ∏è
@JetBlue Thanks. I'm finding lower fares already on other carriers with direct flights. July 8 - 13.
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
@JetBlue #poorservice #poorcommunication #waitingsince 10:51 for bags frm flight 424!!! #jetblue
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@JetBlue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?
@JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
@AmericanAir Was not on board you today just watched report unfold on Twitter but still am very proud!
@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@USAirways Fabulous - thank you so much! Looking forward to taking to the skies with you! :)
@SouthwestAir @LeeAnnHealey I was all, yeah sale fares! I got places to fly! Oh damn, right, I live where SWA doesn't fly. #why
@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
@USAirways @nburnside26  U hate delays, too?  But u have her $$ &amp; are holding her hostage!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
@USAirways after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life's not perfect, I'd heard enough.
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic .
@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.
@AmericanAir at the gate when I get off the plane?
@USAirways Sitting on the runway at phl for the last 30 min because the correct weights for the flight aren't in the system? #jobfail
@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?
@SouthwestAir de-icing is important!
@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!
@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3

@USAirways I'm delayed in TYS #5015, likely gonna miss my connection in CLT to CUN. Gotta get there today. Can you help me?
@AmericanAir @tcunningham10 please call us back to rebook. 7403607771 we can't through!!!!! We need to get to columbus!!!!
@SouthwestAir I have sent the DM, should I continue to wait on hold with a rep, or will you be servicing me here?
@SouthwestAir why must the 4:45pm nonstop BOS-BNA flight stop running after August 7???
@united you're terrible.
@AmericanAir Will my us air points now be combined with yours?
@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
@USAirways any chance of making #561?
@JetBlue thanks so much for your condolences and quick response. It is very much appreciated
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
@JetBlue tell your employees that!
@JetBlue Have a cup coffee and relax while you check out the New Deals and Promotions at Avon, twice a month at Doug @dcoadavon
@united done just now, thanks.
@VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
@SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30
@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
@SouthwestAir So the upcoming RR changes/Deval is trying to tell me not to fly southwest anymore because i am loyal so far. i get it.
@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first.
@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
@USAirways really? No meal vouchers for a 7 hour flight delay out of Virgin Islands...
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@SouthwestAir ok thank you  i hope  so too
@USAirways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed?
@JetBlue  would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor.
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@SouthwestAir One heck of an airline http://t.co/CyoOnZfTdC
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
@USAirways @AmericanAir will one of you please answer the phone?
@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
@SouthwestAir have sent you a DM with the details. Thanks!
@united you need to follow me I order for me to DM....
@JetBlue @weepysweetmonty i heard youre planning on letting people fly in the overhead compartments. why would you do that?
@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling

@AmericanAir I am trying to switch my flight to AA 1359 I am currently on AA 2401 at 6:50am MONDAY morn then AA 2586! Help Me!!
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
@JetBlue thank you!!
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flights today? No precipitation to be scared of!  ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
@USAirways why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?!
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number.
@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@AmericanAir me too. Despite the chaos, I'm still grateful for a flight home ‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@USAirways i've been on hold since 11:30pm  need to reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flight for a morning departure tomorrow.  please help!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir can anyone help me upgrade to buisness select !? Cant seem to get hail of the right area at all .. I know you guys are good
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@USAirways i hope i get the opportunity to join the team with this job opening!
@USAirways even alternate options are allready full...even with hotel voucher...no more room in philly?
@SouthwestAir I urgently need two receipts sent but CS is closed. Can you help?
@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would "eventually get her bag" completely unacceptable
@USAirways  thank you! Glad to be heading home! Great people at your call center!
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!
@USAirways Flight # 604. Thanks.
@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW
@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
@JetBlue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@SouthwestAir Thanks a ton!
@JetBlue I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno http://t.co/6MBVJFlpBM
@SouthwestAir any chance they will change this to include Northeast airports?  JetBlue has.
@united Just got interrogated at the United Club Chicago. #UnitedAirlines #rude #PoorForm
@VirginAmerica wifi AND better seating.
@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
@USAirways DOMINICK L. at La Guardia airport NYC gives the absolute best customer service! Thanku! Checking in made easy!
@VirginAmerica Congrats on winning the @Travelzoo award for Best Deals from an Airline (US) http://t.co/kj1iljaebV
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@JetBlue thanks to the gent on the phone who fixed my BOS-MCO flight and the fee waiver! A320 now :) #flyfi ! I forget her name :(
@SouthwestAir DAL is due for sleet Sun. eve-didn't see it listed for cities that can re-book?  Fly to DCA at 8:10
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?
@SouthwestAir Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, "Unable to price". Please help!
@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help
@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@USAirways I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest.
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!
@united thank you.
@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!
@USAirways you are the worst.
@SouthwestAir Flight Booking Problems all my Late Flight summer travel! Did the AUS-CUN direct flight disappear?
@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
@united Okay, just requested to follow.
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@SouthwestAir I've DM'd you. Thanks!
@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning "due to operation" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!
@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@VirginAmerica got it. All set - Thanks!
@SouthwestAir  after 38 minutes on the phone I'm given another number to call now still on hold with them. http://t.co/1ZT2kEe8up
@SouthwestAir So I am flying Chicago-LAX-PHX just to go spotting at LAX and PHX airports, then I am flying back to Chicago :)
@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
@USAirways how long is that flight? http://t.co/bCwckWtnlE
@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate.
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@JetBlue @JayVig I like the inflight snacks! I'm flying with you guys on 2/28! #JVMChat
@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats
@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
@united I am on 1528 and my connecting flight is 909
@USAirways thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd
@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
@AmericanAir I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?! I'm sorry that's not gonna cut
@VirginAmerica I need a receipt for a flight change. Can you send one?
@JetBlue Just signed up for TrueBlue and booked a flight but keep getting an error when I try to link it to my TB account. What's the deal?
@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
@united some compensation (e.g. upgrade to higher class for my rescheduled flight to MUC today) will be appreciated, though ;)
@SouthwestAir won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone
@SouthwestAir I wanted to thank the great efforts of Jamie McKinnie in BUF she is a true pro! during major delays she was owning it! #raise
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?
@JetBlue They just came out. Thanks for the follow-up. That's why you're the best!
@SouthwestAir i forgot to put my tsa pre number in before I checked in. It is now in my profile but will it be on my boarding pass in the am
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
@AmericanAir refund
@AmericanAir there is two hour wait
@AmericanAir  that's what I am hoping for
@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
@SouthwestAir I left something on a plane landing at Midway last night because I am a responsible adult -- got a number for me to call? TY!
@SouthwestAir has the best customer service!
@AmericanAir today's wait was a violation of #dot #passengerbillofrights http://t.co/GxvFumn3iZ
@VirginAmerica first time flying you all. do you have a different rate/policy for media Bags? Thanks
@SouthwestAir I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service. I'll be trying @Delta
@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
@VirginAmerica thanks for gate checking my baggage on your full flight dfw-lax 883 and giving me early boarding too #sweet
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
@AmericanAir no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today's issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA
@SouthwestAir 4-4 in horrible customer service. Empty seats in early flight wantcharge me double to get home early instead the usual Late Flight
@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked üëç
@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta
@AmericanAir file loc:TJYCQH. Bag at airport since last nite.Not "scheduled" to get PU unt aft 8? WHY? U shld b ashamed. I'm disgusted w/u
@AmericanAir "Thank you for contacting American. The email address you have written to is an unmonitored account‚Äù
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.
@USAirways can you help us figure out our correct six digit confirmation number?
@united 20 minutes plus to get through to a two after the first one transferred me to a spanish hotline is unacceptable!
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
@USAirways @AmericanAir as a Gold Dividends member, why can't I get anyone on phone to handle my Cancelled Flighted American flight tonight üò°
@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
@JetBlue do you sell open tickets? I have a sick relative and may have to travel at a moments notice. Sad but true.
@VirginAmerica OMG FINALLY
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
@SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly.
@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
@AmericanAir Oh trust me. I am in love. It is so beautiful!
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]
@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
@USAirways - what a disaster! Flight 3739, missed passenger count by 5 since it was done manually!!  Really???
@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
@SouthwestAir employees spreading a bit of #MardiGras cheer at 7:30 this morning in Atlanta  #NFTYConvention http://t.co/ttbtY89Ilo
@JetBlue here we go again, 2nd round trip to CA in a week #TrueBlue
@USAirways while I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat.
@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx
@united we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way
@AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
@USAirways 40 minutes in baggage claim and no sign of luggage from our flight. UsAirways- your incompetence is overwhelming
@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
@SouthwestAir @TheAcademy party in #hotlanta http://t.co/x5ZQssJtRB
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :(
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@USAirways thank you
@AmericanAir I'll try to have a great week once I receive it üò©üò≠üíî
@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again
@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert
@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
@UsAirways can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing.
@JetBlue Submitted, hoping for quick decision, tied to another donation we just received:Proposal- 27th Annual GalaOrg- Boundless Readers
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
@USAirways new tag line "but we got you there alive!"
@United lounge @ #Heathrow Used by @AirNZUSA http://t.co/6hJucP694l
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAMING
@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
@united thnx ^LO :-)
@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
@VirginAmerica, the only airline based in Silicon Valley! #disruption #FCmostinnovative #incubator  @FastCompany's http://t.co/wU3LbCNcr9
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157
@SouthwestAir oh my god thank you so much!!! I just sent you a DM
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@AmericanAir Late Flight again geez flt2417 #Late Flight #delays #typical
@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
@VirginAmerica when can I book my flight to Hawaii??
@VirginAmerica thank you! I absolutely will üòé
@united So you are inadequate by accident?
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
@SouthwestAir I enjoyed a call from my good friend he's Flight Booking Problems his flights elsewhere as I tweet one at a time I will tell as many as I can
@AmericanAir aftr 10 hrs bng held hstg at mia bc aa refsd to get med bags. bag fnd aa then refsd to fix tkts they cnceld said $360 to fly
@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
@united For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@SouthwestAir Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.
@Southwestair thanks for leaving me hanging here. #destinationdragons flights all fucked up now. No help?!
@SouthwestAir how do i know that my information is not found on other people's account?  I can see someone else's reservation, rr # and trip
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
@JetBlue you're killing me now. :-) You got me! #smitten #trueblue
@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
@JetBlue absolutely, my girlfriend and I will be Flight Booking Problems our Mexico flights in the next day or two, will send a Tweet when it's done!
@SouthwestAir okay thank you :), also I did get a tweet earlier about 1.5 hrs ago saying I won &amp; should send a DM but then it was deleted?
.@AmericanAir Hopefully it's all fixed. They've got a new aircraft for us- just waiting to board.
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
@VirginAmerica - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn't have flown. I trust he's banned. Crew filed report to @FAANews
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away
@AmericanAir thank you
@AmericanAir No I do not have them yet. Called for baggage status 5 times yesterday.
@USAirways thanks. üòí
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@AmericanAir thank you Mr Parker for screwing over chairman preferred when we fly AA. No #firstclass option and treated like crap by staff
@JetBlue SHUT THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT. üôÖ
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?
@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
@AmericanAir Oh,i already have turned  itover to them, but apparently losing someones bag on their honeymoon doesn't require accountability
@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
@JetBlue I hope so because I fly very often and would hate to change airlines.
@AmericanAir where do I look for cabin crew vacancies?
@USAirways why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks.
@SouthwestAir I noticed the rates increased a few days ago, or the promotion ended. Any idea when another promotion will be coming?? Thanks!
@AmericanAir your message was delayed I just responded
@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
@united tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions?
.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
@united @NTrustOpen can i go  #GolfUnited
@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around
@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@united "We like hearing from you." So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi
@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
@united okay. Thanks.
@JetBlue They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
@SouthwestAir According to TV passenger interviews, the landing was far from "uneventful" with heavy (panic) breaking to
@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?
@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
@united refund?
@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags.
@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
@JetBlue's new CEO Robin Hayes battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Business In Savannah http://t.co/KKAY8XaPs1
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
@AmericanAir especially during a death in the family and still no solution. 96 hours and counting...Thanks
@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways ok. Thank you
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
@USAirways Flight Booking Problems a flight using credit from a previously Cancelled Flightled flight. Can't get thru on the phone and can't book online. Help please.
@JetBlue Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
@AmericanAir 3659 from SGF -&gt; DFW. You might want to clear off the ice for the planes landing. üò≥
@JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would've lost it there around 445pm MT
@AmericanAir I'm flying with your competitor today, starts with an U and ends with D. I will never make that mistake again. #americanforlife
@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
@AmericanAir my flight tomorrow is Cancelled Flighted you guys just keep letting me down
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @saysorrychris Can you follow back for a quick DM? ^SW‚Äùfollowed
@united be  "Chicago's hometown airline" care about your neighbors #SaveTheDiagonals #FlyQuiet #ORDNoise
@USAirways @AmericanAir won't even refund for a flight they Cancelled Flightled #horriblecustomerservice
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to "go left" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
@SouthwestAir hello I was talking with @SouthwestVerity but it says you moved here, they sent me a voucher but does not work can u help?
@USAirways 2 days in a row I call and still can't get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees?
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him "I understand English." His reply?"Our conversation is over."
@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
@JetBlue I bein calling JetBlue no respond I leave my number no call back I think JetBlue is loosing a customer
@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
@united thank you
@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
@USAirways thank you! It's # 1875 from BWI, keep seeing different stats, from delayed to awaiting take off to delayed...
@JetBlue I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you!
@united just sent - thank you!
@AmericanAir How do I change my flight if the phone system keeps telling me that the representatives are busy?
@usairways @BarclaycardUS 1 hr wait so far for customer service. yes bad weather but do air traffic controllers answer your phones?!??
@united These are great fares!!!!!
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@JetBlue he just went above and beyond to be helpful
@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
@SouthwestAir Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer

@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
@USAirways ...be found when he checks in. Now no info. Please DM me and help me fix this NOW. (3/3)
@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever
@SouthwestAir I want one!
@SouthwestAir really this is getting worse as the day goes on. Late Flight leaving then had to be diverted, and now sitting on the tarmac in VA.
@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
@USAirways @USAirways I used my AAdvantage Number connected to the USAirways when I booked tickets for friends. Will it benefit my account?
@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
@AmericanAir @united and a complete lack of faith in your companies. It's really a shame that you think telling me "it's been a challenging"
@SouthwestAir Thank you.
@SouthwestAir strives to be 'Customer Centric' in everything they do - communications, advertising, customer journey, etc. #ANAmarketers
@SouthwestAir mins and no answer. My wife and baby need to get on that flight. She arrived 2 hrs prior. Please help. Venetia Crook
@united silence is very telling
@USAirways you should get better employees‚úåÔ∏è
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
@USAirways @JosephTReis Dont bother. They dont pick up the phone. Worst customer service going
@united Cancelled Flights your flight then sends you an email saying "think about your next flight..." #customer #outrage http://t.co/KkwiwI97A4
@AmericanAir everything for sorted out. Thanks for the help. Excited to get home tonight!
@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@VirginAmerica Thanks so much for the awesome support, you guys rock!
@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early
@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
@AmericanAir I would like to thank the customer service team for their response to my Cancelled Flightled flight but just offering to (cont)
@VirginAmerica announces new nonstop connecting @AUStinAirport &amp; @DallasLoveField, $39 intro: http://t.co/qXnOaQtYN8 http://t.co/JK7qmdfqgf
@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@SouthwestAir do you have any flights from NAS-BWI ton March 23?
@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.
@JetBlue Is it June yet? üòä
@VirginAmerica Thanks for your great customer service today &amp; for helping me get all my travel sorted out!
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
@SouthwestAir will do. Thank you.
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@united volumes, profit up http://t.co/pKfI9bTtzf #aviation #aircargo http://t.co/BBj6kMTYUl
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
@JetBlue Can I bring my dog on board?
@SouthwestAir #tfw1 @JimCramer @AARP TY-Spent total of 3 hrs and 20 mins holding. Cell battery died. Finally made arrangements w kind Rep
@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
@JetBlue flight 462 to Boston delayed due to weather in Tampa?
@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags
@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
@USAirways I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!!
@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
@VirginAmerica Nice to see you expanding in Texas but don't forget about us here in #SanDiego. I would love to see more flights out of here!
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@JetBlue saving my sanity. Leaving it behind for sunshine. #escape #FL #bliss #travel #InDenial #WhatFrozenPipes http://t.co/6TtzEJV3hY
@SouthwestAir I'm excited too, but perhaps you could scale your excitement back by a few weeks...
@AmericanAir here is the ticket they gave me after lying, raising their voice. With no explanation on what happened http://t.co/31cFHtK60r
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@SouthwestAir darn! I bought it on the wrong device! No way to switch I'm sure?
@JetBlue @AmericanAir ah ha! I misread the end date as being 2014 not 2015. Thanks for clarifying :)
@VirginAmerica Can't bring up my reservation online using Flight Booking Problems code
@SouthwestAir I'm running out of money to keep paying for hotel rooms &amp; food in NYC. You don't help people with $ spent
@united, if you mean beyond opaque "maintenance issues", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.
@SouthwestAir may want to direct that to the people at @FurryFiesta tok
@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.
@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
@USAirways CLT, please send more than one cust svc rep to your cust svc counter to assist a line out the door. http://t.co/v24QNp3DOi

@united that's what you have said for years, you are losing customers!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir - Apology accepted! #customerserviceWIN #itravelalot http://t.co/z5znfwkKWP
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
@SouthwestAir I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same.
@USAirways Hi! On my dividend miles account I accidentally listed my newly married name as opposed to my legal name. I am trying to book
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating "Fuck you" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP
@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@AmericanAir I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!

@SouthwestAir 4/9/14, I need to fly from GSP to DSM, but claims there's no sched. avail.  I can book separately, but why not together?
@SouthwestAir LOST Kay Chapman Designs art-luggage for important show. Won't help locate it. Terrible customer service.
@SouthwestAir I've never met my favorite band and it would be sooo amazing to win destination dragons.
@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
@VirginAmerica I love the hipster innovation. You are a feel good brand.
@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
@SouthwestAir using social business roadmap to develop intelligent path to embed social across enterprise #RaganDisney

@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@VirginAmerica got it squared away. Someone picked up as soon as I tweeted. Should have tweeted sooner. üòâ
@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?
@AmericanAir just downloaded the app for iPhone.  Notice drink coupon but nothing is displayed?  Getting ready to fly...
@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on

@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board
@AmericanAir better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!
@AmericanAir Nope, I have not been rebooked.
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
@USAirways @PHLAirport always nice when a customer service manager threatens customers standing in his understaffed lines for the last hour
@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a "sorry for your inconvenience" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed
@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
@JetBlue Airways Corporation Insider Trading Update - Rock Hill Daily http://t.co/vvzkSMFKVw
@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
Thank you. ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @jlhalldc Customer Relations will review your concerns and contact you back directly, John.‚Äù
@JetBlue this is lovely!
@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time.
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@JetBlue It drops 75 when i take off the other two people, and vice versa. back and forth.
@JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to get home to Nashville. I've been stuck in Dallas 2 days will my flight get out in the morning
@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @nlrphoto Those are very beautiful photos!‚Äù Thx! Would marketing dept be interested in buying?
. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.

@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to"arrange pick up"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!

@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@SouthwestAir hello #SouthwestAir I'm  happy to be flying with you this morning DAL-MDW #4053 looking forward to a comfortable fight
@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?

@SouthwestAir thanks for the info and the quick response!
@SouthwestAir That would be great. Thank you! I'll send it over when you follow.
@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.
@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
.@AmericanAir @TyWinter it's really the small things--the details--that make an excellent experience or a really irritating one.
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
@SouthwestAir Can I do the same thing as changing a ticket by Cancelled Flighting my current ticket &amp; buying a replacement online?
@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
@USAirways I have a flight voucher/confirmation code but there is no where for me to enter it on your checkout page while Flight Booking Problems. Pls help
@USAirways just told by supervisor that they won't guarantee the empty seats to standby passengers with flights Cancelled Flightled so can sell them

@VirginAmerica you stink. Flight Cancelled Flighted from PSP to JFK and no notification or ability to rebook #disappointed.  #expected better
@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous

@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
@united you hung up on me again.
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@USAirways Hmmm. Did the flight even really exist or did they just create it last night to get people off their backs? #usairsucks
@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@SouthwestAir Does anyone ever answer your phone? #poor
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
@AmericanAir thank you for doing the best you could to get me rebooked. Agent on phone &amp; addtl resolution on DM was very much appreciated.
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
@SouthwestAir Flight 4315 (N231WN) taxis at @FlyTPA prior to flight to @Fly_Nashville http://t.co/IDRa8keNoH
@united So far so good. Just stepped down in Denver. Next Stop Portland!
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
@USAirways My hubby has a 5hr layover in DFW fm the cxl'd flt. Pls help get him home sooner if you can! Any room on S/by 2 BWI or PHL today?
@USAirways now in a black hole of your phone system
@USAirways rant cont... To top it all off, rescheduled flight to TPA at 10:10 is already delayed. How can they be that bad?
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
@USAirways need seat assignments for one leg of family's return flight - can you please help via Twitter PM?
@SouthwestAir JH thank you. I finally got through the second time.
@united Yes and that is appreciated but misinformation damages credibility.  You may want to have someone observe in Newark #fwiw
@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 ‚Ä¶
@USAirways That link doesn't work on mobile.
@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@AmericanAir Where are your ticket offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use voucher on website, what a headache! PLEASE HELP!
@SouthwestAir Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! My last attempt to win #DestinationDragons tickets was a success! I could not be happier!! :)
@USAirways @AmericanAir I need to move a reservation due to weather in the middle part of the U.S.  I would like to change departing airport
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@USAirways NOT GOOD. been on hold for 1hour (2x/day) since sun. to book 1-way flt dividend miles. agents send me to on hold hell. #furious
@JetBlue Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@SouthwestAir   Thanks
@SouthwestAir Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
@JetBlue are there any food places open at the JFK T5 24//?
@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru
@united i left an item on the plane and have been calling non stop and no one has been answering can you please help
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@AmericanAir dmed the name
@SouthwestAir now flying non stop CMH-OAK has me daydreaming about a trip to the bay...especially in this weather. #OhioProbz
@USAirways job well done from your Philly employee running check,in today. (Tabitha?) helped us in an emergency &amp; vacation saved!!!
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?
@AmericanAir It's sad how I can't afford any long distance trips though. :/
@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@SouthwestAir I know it is hard to predict, but how are flights from Dallas to Nashville tomorrow AM?
@AmericanAir I've been calling your 1800 # all morning to change my name for an upcoming trip but am not able to get through. Please advise!
@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
@JetBlue thanks. Can you change the music in the boarding gates?
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
@united captain "we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates)
@USAirways on hold with 800-428-4322. Flight from DSM to DCA was Cancelled Flighted (4473). Know when it will fly?
@USAirways thanks for nothing
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me...
@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for over 2 hours and my call got disconnected. Thanks a lot.
@USAirways ‚Äî I had exceptional service on flight #403 from IND to PHX!!
@united as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail
@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
@southwestair @cspkcats let us know if we can help
@JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?
@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr
@JetBlue if i ask ask the pilot will he tell me the name of our aiecraft
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?
@JetBlue hi. Just DM'd info
@united no response 3 weeks since complaint submitted and 3 days since you all said you would look into it
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!
@SouthwestAir, got "duped" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
@SouthwestAir thx. Make it right. Help Meagan Fouty Brancato fl#2771 dfw gate 4 preboard w/kids - b4 group A please. Please.
@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tonight at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is flight overbooked? Have funeral to attend!
@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout
@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
@VirginAmerica @SSal thanks!
@USAirways how long for a reply
@SouthwestAir where is mines?
@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries.
@JetBlue Using JetBlue miles?
@VirginAmerica classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal.
@AmericanAir After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers
@JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect
@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work.
@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@united Can I add miles from my January Air China flight to my MileagePlus account?
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@united round trip*
@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights
@SouthwestAir just got mine..now where to go??
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons I'm a HUGE FAN! I would love tix to your show!
@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united did I win :)
@SouthwestAir Do you still offer discounts on seats for children under 2? We would rather put him in a seat than in a lap!
@SouthwestAir  the agents werenot helpful told me I would have to pay 2chng even though I Tld them going2 bwi whch is part of trvl advsry
@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but...
@USAirways pilot tells me that all @AmericanAir and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure.

Hey @USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys!
@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all.
@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!
@SouthwestAir flt 648 from Buf to MCO. Conf#FGKXV5. Please also look into reimburse for car 587701925COUNT that I had to Cancelled Flight
@JetBlue  no ... I am guessing I have to call someone
@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info....
@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land.
@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@united it's freezing on the gate bridge#waitingforbags#united#EWR
@USAirways - 800# referred me back to baggage services but I left the airport. I was on seat 17A
@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed "help"
@USAirways you need to figure your scheduling out! #worstflightexperienceever #getmehome
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?‚Äù SMA
@USAirways Your software is broken. "Call Customer Support" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.
@SouthwestAir why are the ticketing lines in Las Vegas so unorganized??  Mass craziness. Half of the ticketing stations unmanned.
@AmericanAir My flights tomorrow were Cancelled Flighted, can't do anything online, and can't get through on phone. Help?
@jetblue waiting for flt 105 to Chicago. Why hasn't aircraft left buffalo yet?

@AmericanAir can you take care @Cowboycerrone please.  Thanks
@SouthwestAir my flight at BWI is delayed and I will miss my flight in Denver, is there a way to find out if they will hold the plane?
@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?
@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous.
@USAirways 1917. Thanks for the 5 hour layover in LA tooüëç Icing on the cake. At least your staff was courteous and helpful.. Not #unreal
@JetBlue I cri
@JetBlue thanks!
@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@united at the gate! IAD to RDU
@JetBlue pilot: "Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane." Thanks guy
@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
@USAirways provided the best service for me today! Thank you so much :)
@USAirways, if I rebook on another airline after my flight was Cancelled Flightled, do you reimburse? I need to get home today, not Tuesday.
@united is my favorite airline.
@JetBlue says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;)
@united i understand, thanks
@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?
@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@JetBlue I agree!!!  If only there was a frequent tweeter discount so I could fly to see more friends! üòÄ@Tinman2IronMan @meggersrocks
can you not? RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/413GiAL0yl
@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
@JetBlue Flight 152 (N559JB) "Here's Looking at Blue Kid" departs @MCO enroute to @BostonLogan http://t.co/qeaDA92MW6
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
JetBlue reading the NYTimes. ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lvIrTDtqly‚Äù
@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced.
@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?
@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@AmericanAir why is raleigh not on the updated southern states advisory???
@USAirways after a crappy flight due to delays and rude staff members I'm happy to report after paying $25 to check my luggage it's ruined
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND

@USAirways what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight
@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
.@JetBlue i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum.
@VirginAmerica loved it. Can't wait for Monday's return flight... Mostly just to watch the inflight safety video again. #sorrynotsorry
@JetBlue Thanks so much for talking to me! The article about #Twitter chats came out great! http://t.co/rKorHvR9z1 #contentmarketing
@SouthwestAir flights still going to DAL?
@united @annricord 0162431184663.3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace
@JetBlue thanks for your reply. It was flight 1572.
@SouthwestAir Thanks!!! :)  It is good to air on the side of caution
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
@SouthwestAir If you could get me on the 12:15 flight! My 10:10 has been delayed until 1:05.
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@USAirways if I qualify for free 1st checked bag, is that applied at checkin? Same for using companion tickets?
@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir thx - i managed to figure it out by trying diff confirmation #s as i booked. just annoying it's not readily available!
@VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky.
@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@USAirways What is with your lost &amp; found.  My wife lost her phone in Philly, &amp; followed your web instructions to call an 800#.  No answer.
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@AmericanAir redirect my flight without telling me, service is abysmal.
@SouthwestAir @gruber Finally.
@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@SouthwestAir please refund my ticket. What a terrible experience. #southwestfail
@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@SouthwestAir @bgr1061 luv SWA myself and my employees use you always!!
@USAirways flight 614 keeps telling a few more mins to take off its been an hour. First time with you not the best #lies #brokenpromises
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/yZH4ZRQM0i‚Äù really JetBlue? #fleek?!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ hell no... Yall petty
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
@JetBlue I want you guys to be the first to fly to #Cuba, from NYC.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@SouthwestAir huge problem with someone whose ticket was Cancelled Flighted mid trip. Can you DM?
@SouthwestAir hey southwest! Help me find a flight from Nashville - Washington DC or Raleigh for under $150 on March 15 please!
I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference
@JetBlue I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song "I'm Blue" while flying on JetBlue.
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
@AmericanAir done
.@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same.
@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?
@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service
@JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying.
@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service
@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
@SouthwestAir flight to San Diego is delayed per usual.. take me home!
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified.
@JetBlue u cool
@JetBlue #Bluemanity @AirlineAdviser loves this. Have a great time flying this
@SouthwestAir beautiful day in Seattle! http://t.co/iqu0PPVq2S
@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
@AmericanAir followback
@USAirways Stars aligned. Connecting flight was delayed into CLT. Made it! Thanks, glad to know someone is listening. Time for 80¬∞ in MoBay!
@VirginAmerica of course! I work for @VirginAtlantic and I'm obsessed with the entire Virgin family!!
@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers.
@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem.
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
@SouthwestAir I think me and my group could use some nice cold drinks once we get in the air...we are all over 21 üòúüòé
@VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled?
@VirginAmerica has flight number 276 from SFO to Cabo San Lucas arrived yet?
@SouthwestAir myself and 2 others
@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?
.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
@SouthwestAir Show Jacksonville some üíùtoo!  We want #3ticketsforJax!
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred line phone wait was 15 minutes. I hung up, not feeling A-list-ey!
@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
@JetBlue #fail My wife on the phone asking to switch flight times. In mid switch gets disconnected. Now Cancelled Flightled! No new time! No call back
@VirginAmerica adds Austin-Dallas Love Field route. http://t.co/XWJoL55FLH http://t.co/Y8AOrMfkaC

@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@USAirways but my bag is still missing
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@AmericanAir the customer service today is unsat, Flight cnx, not notified, called for 6 hours and the phone line does not even let me hold
@SouthwestAir very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flightsüòî I should've flew @Delta
@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
‚Äú@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM your confirmation code so we can forward your kind words.‚Äù sent
@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
@SouthwestAir @PHLAirport Will Flight 2155 that arrives at E11 be a penguin plane?

@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
@JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue.
@USAirways - just passed the 3 hour mark #onholdwith you for THIS call.  Gave up after 2.5 this morning.
@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there.
@JetBlue are @AskAmex Amex Plat holders provided access or a credit in the Airspace Lounge in JKF?
@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min üò• #fail

@SouthwestAir nice work on the update!
@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
@SouthwestAir my sinuses had to contend with two painful landings rather than one, and we missed a preregistration window. Beyond frustrated

@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday
@SouthwestAir  Tried to DM you, it won't let me as it says you are not following me.
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes
@JetBlue Celebrates 15-Year Anniversary With New Livery - Digital Journal http://t.co/U5HXri6Crx
@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@JetBlue thanks!
@USAirways my flight got Cancelled Flightled to Charlotte. Been on hold for an hour, pls pick up!
@SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United "coworkers" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great.
@SouthwestAir can u follow so I can DM a confirmation number I need confirmed to Cancelled Flight?I will call to confirm Monday for refund
@USAirways no your not!
@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@united thanks for making sure they hear the message!
@JetBlue "Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life." üòä
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@USAirways too Late Flight.
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
@SouthwestAir Thank u Thank u Thank u for coming through for us! I sincerely didn't think it would happen. &lt;3 #SWA #THANKYOU
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?

@SouthwestAir thx - fingers crossed they are found.

@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
@JetBlue Annnndddd, I just booked my flight. That was easy.
@JetBlue sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
@AmericanAir please email me at temorris2010@hotmail.com. willing to discuss my experience &amp; give another try would like to speak directly
@VirginAmerica ok! first time flying with you tonight :)
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
@USAirways wow.. Flight Cancelled Flightled, slept on the floor at the airport and now flight delayed
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ

@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@AmericanAir I fly American because of family but severe weather excuse so I can't call to make change, why have a computer if u cant modify
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone
@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer.
@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated.
@SouthwestAir just DMed you guys!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls
@VirginAmerica I was so glad it was mentioned. I took my first virgin flight a few years back and it was a transformative experience.
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@JetBlue just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? @PhD_Mama_
@SouthwestAir  I can go.  I want to badly!!!!   I don't know how to DM.  Can I e-mail you?   Help!!!  wmn4life@hotmail.com
@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as "on time" #updateyourwebsite #489
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@SouthwestAir I would.
@JetBlue Will do. Thanks!
@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?
@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
@USAirways Cancelled Flights my flight to NY 3 times, then once I make it here they decided for S&amp;Gs they'll Cancelled Flight my return flight too. Thanks.
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
@AmericanAir my flight to San Angelo via Dallas from Orlando Cancelled Flighted help! On hold and disconnect

@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
@SouthwestAir He is going to file a formal complaint, this should have never happened. Please direct us to the right department.
@SouthwestAir woohoo that just made my day. I looked and just couldn't find that, thank you!
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
@SouthwestAir get me on flight 4146 to denver and I'll be more than happy !!!!!

@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got "unspecified errors"
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
Can I put sun in my carry on? RT ‚Äú@united: @ant_kneee Right now 0 would be a heat wave, so enjoy the warmth! Can you bring some home? ^JJ‚Äù

@SouthwestAir have a prompt for consumers for prompt for customer service instead of having customers on hold for 1.5 hrs
@JetBlue Not for the dates or destination I'm headed üòî
@united @perfectomobile You really shouldn't use the word 'crashing.' Just sayin'.
@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@JetBlue I have more flights that I'd love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. Is there a historical limit?
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews. Hands down.
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
Bingo! ‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll be happy to reach out to Noah so we can make this right. ^MR‚Äù
@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
@SouthwestAir I'm following now
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
@JetBlue incredible PR team. üëèüëèüëèüëè
@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
@United DO NOT FLY UNITED WITH CHECKED BAGGAGE! It will never find you!
@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going

@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
@united just DM'd
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.

@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
@united agent, "You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full." Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited
@SouthwestAir I have a voucher w swa that expires 4/10. An extension would be a lot of luv
@JetBlue Left my coat on flight 453 this morning in overhead bin.  Reported seat 12A, but I was 11A.  Thx.  Ticket 2792125083854
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep "if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow." 1/2
@SouthwestAir I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :(
@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
@USAirways Can you help with a seat assignment?  5 people flight 694, PHX to HNL, seats are split up.  Anything you can do will be great.
@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
@SouthwestAir thanks for your excellent response time and assistance! All set :)
@JetBlue thank you for the information.
@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold trying to reschedule Cancelled Flightled flight. Hold music stopped, but no one's answering. How can I reach a rep?
@SouthwestAir an entire flight of luggage missing at #dca.  Over an hour and nobody knows anything.
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
@AmericanAir flight 1019 I need 2 b on the first flight out frm MIA 2 TPA. I'm extremely irritated. I've been at this airport for 5.5 hrs.
@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.
@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
@SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead.
@SouthwestAir thank you so much completely made things right!
@VirginAmerica shares rise on Q4 financial results - USA TODAY http://t.co/lFS4PEFE6y

@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless.
@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
@JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.
@SouthwestAir I would sell my nonexistent soul to go see #DestinationDragons

@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/tY9C0Gae2o‚Äù Lol
@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
@jetblue is there no way to switch to earlier flight to JFK even if I checked a bag?
@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
@SouthwestAir well my mom called earlier and you guys had her on hold for close to an hour
@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
@JetBlue thanks so much for help Us, u r amazing!
@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together?
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency
@SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend.
@SouthwestAir how can customers get in touch with you internationally from Mexico for lost baggage
@SouthwestAir you should know the crew today on flight #1071 AUS to PDX was awesome! #SWA
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@SouthwestAir should offer cdn border towns incentive to fly since exchange rates are #hurt. #customerappreciation #gaincustomers #keepem2
@JetBlue Is there an issue with your website and logging on? (App too?) I know I am entering info correctly but cannot sign in! :(
@AmericanAir thanks!
@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho.
@USAirways 799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse.
@SouthwestAir I love you guys! Had to take a few other airlines this week...makes me love and appreciate y'all so much more! #onlywaytofly
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
@united MR, she's on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc
@SouthwestAir SEA to DEN. South Sound Volleyball team on its way! http://t.co/tN5cXCld6M
@SouthwestAir are you hiring for flight attendants right now
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson Ah! Wish I was there! Good luck!
@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA.
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flight VX413? One sec its delayed, on my to airport, the next its Cancelled Flightled?Gonna email or call me to reschedule?
@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do
@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@USAirways will never travel with you again. This is insanity. storms are inevitable but making us hold to just add a lap child #badservice
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@USAirways I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT
@JetBlue my phone number when you have any news for me is (631)891-5722
@united love the new 1st class breakfast!
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@USAirways your agent did not say
@JetBlue Apparently not.
@JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided
üò©üò©üò©‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBHTlZgH2C‚Äù
@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
@SouthwestAir 9 hrs in Baltimore, still not going to get my baggage to greenville w me. This is just unbelievable.
üò¢üò¢ RT‚Äú@JetBlue: @Peaches275 Oh no! Unfortunately, the code must be entered at the time of purchase in order to qualify for the points.‚Äù
@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
@JetBlue hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@USAirways what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class, I booked the regular ticket
@USAirways  I just reserved a flight with my companion certificate, where do I mail the certificate for verification???? THX!!!
@SouthwestAir quick question: let's say I book a flight (I did so) and you then drop the price. Do I get the cheaper rate?
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN OMG IM DEAD IM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU YES YES
@USAirways usually "sorry" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk.
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
@VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
@USAirways Oh well. I'll get to Cancun eventually.
@JetBlue of course !!!!
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
@JetBlue I flew to San Francisco from Fort Lauderdale with you last year, had a fantastic time so would like to go back !
@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam
@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@AmericanAir yes I did but no response.
@USAirways How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion?
@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
@AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue üòîüòìüò§
@JetBlue I'm flying your airline just out of #LGA üò∑
@VirginAmerica I luv ur people and product! 1 thing is y do u charge for herbal tea but not black tea? I'm not a caffeine drinker
@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
@VirginAmerica can u help this üë∏ @FreyaBevan_Fund needs urgent treatment inüá∫üá∏2y old battling cancer could u help with flights üíó#freyasfund
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@USAirways So you Cancelled Flightled my flight AGAIN? are you paying for my hotel?!
.@SouthwestAir 3 days &amp; still not home. Not even off the ground. 3. Days. #PastMyPatienceExpirationDate
@USAirways #tbt every day.
@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir followed. I tried to @USAirways record locator number, gave me an error code
@AmericanAir #AATeam thanks for working in very rigorous weather conditions for all
@SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you
@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you CAN control your systems, processes, people and attitudes. #anotherfail
@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
@SouthwestAir Thank you SWA and Shannon G. @LASairport (C22) for being a miracle worker! #awesome
.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take "18 hours" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is "the best we can"
@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
@AmericanAir Group Cancelled Flights close to a thousand #flights Monday http://t.co/v1RADYKEP2
@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length.
@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@USAirways Bravo handling MSP to PHX # 2023 today. Delayed, Late Flightr Cancelled Flightled. Missed surprise 60th bday which was reason for trip.Never again
@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
@USAirways so i ask for ice and the attendant snaps "i dont have ice on this cart" not 5 min Late Flightr 2 cups of ice to the people 2 rows ahead.
@SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn't very clear to me.
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am
@JetBlue Great Thank you, lets hope so! Could you please notify me if flight 2302 leaves JFK? Thank you again
@AmericanAir Any way that we could look at other options for today?
@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt
@SouthwestAir Looks like 'On February 19, 2015, we will open our schedule for sale through October 30, 2015' - know what time that will be?
@JetBlue Thank you for the JetBlue Credit. Nice save :-)
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
@SouthwestAir My brother &amp; his girlfriend‚Äôs flight Cancelled Flightled 3 times, now leaving 72 hours Late Flight and dropping letter grades at school. Help?
@SouthwestAir Airline trouble &amp; not getting satisfactory customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
@USAirways your customer service in Philly is deplorable, rude &amp; unprofessional gate agents after delays &amp; Cancelled Flightations #takingthistothetop
@USAirways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
@USAirways will you be issuing a travel advisory for CLT for Thursday?  A significant snow storm is in the way Wednesday night.
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay.
@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE AND I FOLLOW YOU BACK;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏èüòâ)
@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@SouthwestAir can u get me on flt #3768 instead of #2522 rt now
@AmericanAir Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I'm hating. But my job is concerned
@JetBlue flight 2008
@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight.
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@SouthwestAir Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points.
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
@JetBlue Call me when you do and we‚Äôll have to hook up!
@AmericanAir thanks
@SouthwestAir sent
@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!
@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone.
@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ‚úàÔ∏è brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
‚Äú@AmericanAir: We hope you enjoy the #WinterWeather and brought your warm coat and gloves, Maria!‚Äù Yup! New beanie http://t.co/AnEqXZR4bp
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
@JetBlue thanks anyways @SouthwestAir has my back! Awesome rate &amp; amazing customer service #nomoreaggravation
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?Y have i had no correspondence
@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@JetBlue Get me out of this 7 degree weather...here we go! #westpalmbeachbound  üåû‚úàÔ∏èüë∏
@JetBlue @L_Burley11 -- the best!!!
@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!
.@JetBlue @ZKatcher üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇOMG. Bored &amp; read through this convo.. Seems like JetBlue is on point.
@JetBlue flight booked! Heading out to California with the @WikiPearl team for  @NatProdExpo on March 6-8! Can't wait! #ExpoWest
@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
@AmericanAir have your experts seen this? this is right at RDU airport. http://t.co/mPliO6DYgn
@AmericanAir but don't you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain.
@JetBlue that's what we've been told however how would this work if you're going overseas? Bottom line is passengers feel as if there's (1)
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
@AmericanAir why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
@USAirways followed!
@united we can't all be american airlines I suppose... http://t.co/0EWj7oKlji
@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
@SouthwestAir we can let #bags flutter because we charge travelers that had to change dates #fullprice and we don't let them travel
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
Well @AmericanAir we won't be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free!
@SouthwestAir - just got it back about 20 mins ago. Went about 18 hrs w/o it but I appreciate the support. $50 voucher + $50 for essentials.
@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
@USAirways been sitting at gate for over 25 min on us 728! What gives???
@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times.
@VirginAmerica You have the best flight attendant ever!!! http://t.co/PxdEL1nq3l
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. üòí
@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 "Plane not ready". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed
@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir I'm getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas....
@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@JetBlue got it. Thanks
@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight "delay" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help.
@united That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve been 1K for over 5 years, and you‚Äôre making it harder to keep me loyal.
@SouthwestAir I would but you need to follow me first ;-)
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@united Hi if a premium ec upgrade was paid for &amp; then a mileage BF upgrade done is the prem Eco upgrade fare refunded?
@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around.
@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
@USAirways flying high thanks!
@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
@southwestair really?!? 1.5 hours ON THE PLANE and at the gate??? Jax2BNA. Like we haven‚Äôt waited days to get home #notokay
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
@SouthwestAir y airline I fly with, but haven't seen anything like this yet!
@united can you change DKYDE6 to 4583&gt;36 on 2/23 instead of 3636&gt;606&gt;36; original reservation was for 4404&gt;36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled.
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons any info on #DestinationDragons ?? me &amp; @sammi_jon3s need to know..
@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
@AmericanAir thanks, me too
@united YOU SUCK!
@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
@USAirways is really good at deferring responsibility.
@VirginAmerica on iPad and iPhone, clicking the CHECKIN link in the email I received at 24hrs before flight
@SouthwestAir Learn how to give folks on multiple flights the same day boarding position at least if you can't give them  boarding passes.
@JetBlue could I get a free flight to Vegas since it's my bdayüòè‚ò∫Ô∏è
@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition.
@JetBlue Hawaii! Get me somewhere warm &amp; I can find some good to do. #FlyItForward
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.
@SouthwestAir how do I find travel funds I have available to use f/ past changed flights? don't see an option in my account.
@SouthwestAir I absolutely will. Where can I send it?
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing.
@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it...
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?
@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail
@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. üòû
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@united awesome new plane flight 1701
@JetBlue üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ yall are really better then American Airlines though.
@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
@USAirways What is going on with flight 1826 from PHL to PHX? 10 mins to estimated departure nobody has board and no update.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@AmericanAir the status on my itinerary says on request in red. What's that mean?
@VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail
@SouthwestAir we had early bird, and it was great. Your employees were awesome. It was 3 passengers who killed the buzz.
@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
@united got it, look forward to hearing from you soon
@SouthwestAir sent
@SouthwestAir yeah it happens. The PHX airport has extra long waits all spring long. Something locals know but tourist don't just FYI
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
@SouthwestAir retiring with my hubby and it's our 25th wedding anniversary this year! Companion pass please!!
@JetBlue thank you!
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
@JetBlue Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome
@VirginAmerica happy to spend the day together. Let's do this!
@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
@JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry!
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I'll keep checking. I'm trying to book our first Disney World vacation.
@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded.
@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
@USAirways nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me
@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for
Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
@SouthwestAir RDU flights expected to be ok this afternoon and tonight?
@SouthwestAir What an awesome flight Dallas 2 NY. Virgin America refused bc of my child's peanut allergy but u guys didn't. Thanks! üëçüòä
@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
@USAirways really!??
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
@JetBlue you know it!!
@SouthwestAir  no such thing as a free flight. Gonna be spending $100 on board rental bc #swa couldn't get my baggage to greenville w me.
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
@SouthwestAir Flight 1700. (PHX TO LAX) Wheels stop.  Glad to be home!  Thanks to the professionals both up front and in the cabin!!!
@USAirways is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182
@SouthwestAir.   50th Anniversary on April 10th. Still. Sweethearts.  Companions.  Lifetime.  Sons.  Families. Love.
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@SouthwestAir is anyone answering phones to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?
@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho
@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
@southwestair cool shot of the moon and one of your fleet http://t.co/kl9BAiMES6
@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work.
@USAirways Thanks for the information!
@SouthwestAir rocks! Open letter to flight attendant. http://t.co/zFrOINPSzI  &lt; my child was inspired.  Thank you.
@SouthwestAir best airline üëå
@USAirways -beg to differ. 4 things booked wrong and still not fixed. Get your act together! #USAirSucks
@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
@AmericanAir I have an issue that requires a bit more than a tweet to explain, do y‚Äôall have an email?
@JetBlue Exciting times ahead! üòÅüéâ
@usairways Ok thank you‚Ä¶I call from Spain to US for seating assistance!
. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it
@JetBlue ANYWHERE!! http://t.co/FeFHPmFPlE
@SouthwestAir Gary Kelly should be ashamed of himself running a corporation in this way
@JetBlue can't seem to DM you guys.. JDHADP
@SouthwestAir thankyou :))‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
@USAirways now on hold for 75 minutes.
@SouthwestAir beautiful view flying into San Jose, CA this evening http://t.co/SxVaGbRTlI
@USAirways I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news
@JetBlue flight 2302 from JFK to BUF.
@usairways I don't understand why I can't get my missing miles? I was on the flight, it was in my Dividend Miles Account‚Ä¶ #help
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@USAirways thanks for slowing the inbound plane down so that we didn't need to worry about 4438 EYW being Late Flight. Great holz ahead. Cheers! üòÄ
@united i have items of sentimental value that I'm heartbroken are missing
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
@SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time.
@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
Listen, im not gonna deny this but... RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/eNXV64RkbU
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@JetBlue which type plane is flt 1065 from bos to rsw?
@USAirways @AmericanAir seriously with all the service issues you are having right now this is what you decide to tweet?? Unbelievable
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love flying Southwest! Best flight attendants ever!
@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
@JetBlue great to see the RedSox plane and your reminder you ‚ù§Ô∏èNY side by side at JFK #catsanddogslivingtogether http://t.co/KFUyYoKUFv
@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
@SouthwestAir now accepting #Apple's Passbook app for boarding passes. App works on #iPhone &amp; #iPodTouch, not #iPad. http://t.co/XxSaomBdGS
@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here.
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?
@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
@AmericanAir I did
@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
@AmericanAir cannot talk to any agents keep getting hung up on crazy
@USAirways yesterday we were delayed for SIX hours w/lil to NO explanation we paid LOTS of $$ 2 fly w/u &amp; this is how u treat ur customers?
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!
@JetBlue status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow?
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the "T5 experience" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month.
@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status
@AmericanAir will do. I also passed the website around to other passengers.
@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA.
@USAirways @PHLAirport can you pm me w answer if flt to 4278 is still on time. Been on ground over an hr w no gate. Need help. Pls
@SouthwestAir pls help me get this resolved &amp; reimbursement made.  gracias, rico; pls send me private msg with phone number or email address
@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
@SouthwestAir companion pass please!
Aww, is it? @JetBlue I guess now I need to book a flight to somewhere warm ASAP! Any suggestions?
@VirginAmerica hi, i did not get points on my elevate account for my most recent flight, how do i add the flight and points to my account?
@JetBlue is the trueblue site broken at the moment?
@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher
@JetBlue OK cool.  I need to listen to some Dre and Snoop en route to LA.  That would have been a shame.
@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.
@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/JMnkJ6Bmc2‚Äù Jet Blizzue in the hizouse.
@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh üòï
@USAirways Yes, I get that. I‚Äôm asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I‚Äôve given you?
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
@AmericanAir Why doesn't anyone make a better effort to retain customers. It should be an easy fix, I just want to travel AA.
@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
^CB how do you know? @SouthwestAir
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral.
@AmericanAir looking for status of flight 1388 schedule for 5:15 am tomorrow morning, thank you
@SouthwestAir are you kidding me?  I needed help yesterday. I'm now landed and waiting for my connection.  Never will I fly southwest again!
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
@JetBlue Big thanks to Ricardo Olavarria at Reagan Airport. Fixed our ticket and made sure we made it for our friend's wedding #greatservice
@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!

@SouthwestAir could u put one here in Baltimore? http://t.co/vLCI2KV1IP
@USAirways OK, I guess the weather has been rough but I have been trying to sort out missing air-miles for days. Any suggestions?
@JetBlue sure thing!
@USAirways has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix!
@SouthwestAir no flights out of #nashville today? Are you kidding me?!?! Why are other airlines flying and you're not?! So frustrated!!
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
@USAirways my TSA precheck isn't showing up on my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow...help!? #USAirways #TSAPreCheck
@VirginAmerica I didn't today... Must mean I need to take another trip!
@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
@AmericanAir Can you upgrade (with cash) to Main Cabin Extra after buying an AAdvantage Mileage Saver (using miles)? Can't seem to do it...
@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@VirginAmerica YES FYI  MY BFF
@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
@JetBlue yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it's your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially
@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
@USAirways wont waive fees for flight Cancelled Flightlation due to #neptune To use credit, $200 fee. Couldnt reach destination @BostonBBB #notmyfault
@SouthwestAir and @USAirways have Cancelled Flightled flights after 525 pm today due to winter storm. Travelers urged to contact carrier for info.
@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
@JetBlue no, but we're on the flight leaving from Boston to Seattle right now. :) flight 597
@SouthwestAir I love you Southwest. I accept all your flight attendants and their many talents always! #flySWA
@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
@JetBlue my credit card company accidentally marked my jet blue tickets as fraud, then corrected their mistake and reposted the money.
@AmericanAir ticks me off.
@united how much does a ski bag cost to check?  Bag contains 1 pair is skis and one pair of poles
@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN OMG BEST AIRLINE EVER
@united Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost &amp; found report
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@SouthwestAir  at fort launder dale and the gate agent can't switch flights to an earlier flight but we can on our phone...ridiculous
@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}
@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
@AmericanAir arrived in lax from ord flight AA1657 NO LUGGAGE
@JetBlue look what I capture at Uvf http://t.co/Lj2ZXZN8kG
@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent
@JetBlue no, they're too busy being awesome and trying to get us out ASAP. I'll deal.
@SouthwestAir is there a way to know who checked my bag on the curb? She was awesome!!! And want to be sure she gets a high five!
@JetBlue figured it out 4 flight 2morrow. Hard to believe with oil so low, and the killing u make that even part of a hotel can't be comp'd
@USAirways captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. "Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane" haha thanks!
@USAirways Absolutely!! The staff was amazing!!
@united @baldordash Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr.  Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment!
@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
@usairways - thanks for the 5+ hour flight from PIT to PHX with zero entertainment. Guess why I have a quarter million + miles on Delta
@SouthwestAir can i have my bags back   ding!!
@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
OMGee!!! @JetBlue #OnFleek Why @JetBlue Why?!? üò≠üòÅüòÜüòµ How many people even know what that means, lol?
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@VirginAmerica to start 5xweekly #A319 flights from to #Dallas @DallasLoveField #Austin on 28APR #avgeek
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@SouthwestAir love bridesmaid dancing Can't wait for you to fly into puerto Vallarta and kick united ass!
@SouthwestAir 45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice
@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
@USAirways I left my son's Duke hat on flight #1761 last night. It says "Mason" on the back. Any way of locating it? Thanks in advance!
@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@AmericanAir airport to figure this out or can someone tell me now? Flight is from San Juan to San Diego
@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?
@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone.
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@AmericanAir good morning, please let me know if I will be able to get those luggage tags.   Tx!
@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?
@USAirways How do I get a receipt for a change fee when I originally booked with miles?
@USAirways looks like you lost another customer  when you stranded @41CGQueen at CLT she vows never to fly with you again #smoothtransition

@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?
@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
@JetBlue I DM'd my confirmation code... Thanks again for your help! Mommy, daddy, and kids appreciate it!
Thanks @united, great news that u won't refund tickets due to a bad exchange rate. I knew u would come to your senses @gg8929 @UnitedAppeals
@USAirways ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.
@united it just goes round &amp; round, it's be going on for weeks,
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits
@USAirways unfortunately patience won't get me to my boat that leaves at 4 pm. I was on hold watching all flights fill up.

@SouthwestAir everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1
@SouthwestAir AH - did DM, no reply. On hold now over 2hrs. Just spent over $1k to get a United flight tmrw to get home. #lame
@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
@USAirways what is going on with the computers? Why is my flight grounded? Why does your airline suck so much? #UnansweredQuestions
@JetBlue  anywhere... away from this snow globe to warmth sand and palm trees..
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now.
@JetBlue I was returning from @FoodNetwork #SOBEWFF so I had limited carry on space in my tummy. Next flight I'll try that snack!
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
@USAirways ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue
@AmericanAir Thanks for sharing these photos! Round of applause for your crews! We appreciate all their hard work.
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@JetBlue Are there issues with the mobile boarding passes? My app keeps crashing when I try accessing. Thanks!
@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on

Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@USAirways  glad to be home and that your great people got me home safely. Sad for others who didn't get back bc of scheduling problems.
@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won üò≠üôè
@JetBlue I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue
@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
@USAirways it takes a month?
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight.
@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
@USAirways Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate.
@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed.
@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ.
@SouthwestAir I'm on the 10:55 flight! Everyone has been so nice and helpful! I'm just hoping we'll get to fly out! Thank you! ;)
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/5fmipW9dhi
@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
@USAirways Said only way to get on plane about to leave that would make my connection was a $75 fee. Instead of earlier, I am now Late Flightr!
.@USAirways we r rebooked. got conflicting info abt baggage. Y no extra plane batteries on hand? Y no comped admirals club for 9 hr wait?
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened
@JetBlue I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today.
@AmericanAir record locator oaaret got email we couldn't be rebooked but got no notification flight was Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It's not letting me add it online....
@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@JetBlue alittle more money to book our flights... we're 1/2 way there :)
@USAirways just realized my @AmericanAir advantage number wasn't used for my flight.  How do I get my ff miles?
@JetBlue do bags still fly for free anymore?
@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
@JetBlue the one man in baggage office says "I dunno". HELP
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
@JetBlue 's Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual!  #jetbluehatesbtv
@AmericanAir thx for nothing on getting us out of the country and back to US. Broken plane? Come on. Get another one.
@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff
@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed.
‚Äú@USAirways: @hegshmeg O‚Äù thank you for that elaborate response
@united Thanks!  Good to know.
@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
@VirginAmerica now it's just t-minus 32 minutes until my Elevate a Silver upgrade window opens . #FreeNeverSucks üòÉüëç
@AmericanAir check your dm pls
@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@SouthwestAir @JasonWhitely flt 947 Emer stop in Albuquer for a heart condition, crew was awesome, pilot was Maverick on the divert.
@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious "costs" that you incur, @united?
@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
@JetBlue i love this song &lt;3 thanks @JetBlue
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@AmericanAir I sent you a DM, can you please help.
@united please. You moved my seats and lost my upgrade. I had seat 20L. I have a ticket in my hand for 20L
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
@SouthwestAir 3 + hrs w/out bags being returned to us after flight 2464 Cancelled Flightled. Maybe put a couple people on it?
@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
@VirginAmerica thanks!
@united the worst customer service in Denver.
@USAirways @JosephTReis Can't believe advice to call customer service. I was on hold for 3 hrs this morning and finally gave up.
@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
@SouthwestAir  Just left there  Friday!
@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
@AmericanAir stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
@AmericanAir You have a lot on your pLate Flight dealing with Cancelled Flightlations and weather tonite. Those are more important. I know you will respond.
@united now 1558 from IAH to EWR has broken entertainment system and no WiFi despite info on app: http://t.co/FY6f9rZB9k
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
@VirginAmerica Is flight 0769 out of LGA to DFW on time?
@SouthwestAir has a beautiful fleet. What a perfect evening to fly! http://t.co/XMZ3Tf9Ix8
@SouthwestAir you guys rock! So easy, quick, and affordable to change my flight. #bestairlineever #neverchange
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?
@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales
@VirginAmerica Moodlighting is the only way to fly! Best experience EVER! Cool and calming. üíú‚úà #MoodlitMonday
@USAirways still Effin waiting... Not weather delays, not engine trouble, but lack of crew?  Are you shitting me?
@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
@southwestair has posted flight schedule covering the date range of @_defcon_ 23
@SouthwestAir You rerouted my bf's flight and he's diabetic with little insulin; even though we tried to change it, the agent wouldn't do it
@united we got it, thanks.
@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful.
@SouthwestAir always when I fly SW. #loyalRRmember
@united stuck in DC trying to get to Denver. The engine shut down twice on us at the terminal. Got any available flights for me?
@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@AmericanAir appreciate update. Have also appreciated our pilots effort to explain to us just now. Accurate, authoritative comms is vital.
@AmericanAir working over time tonight?  Got delayed 2 days .. In SJU .. Could be worse :)
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine friendliest employees
@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
@SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh?
.@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported
@USAirways can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight?
@USAirways @British_Airways three hour flight delay. On the phone for 45min and counting.
@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? üå¥üå¥ It's so cold here.
@JetBlue why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous.
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
@united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund... üòëüò© http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2
@southwestair Cancelled Flightling flights due to winter weather is totally understandable, but it would sure be nice if you would answer your phones.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to reach your customer service for TWO days. I have received zero response. Never traveling AA again.
@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@USAirways worst experience with you. Cancelled Flightled flight, no voucher and no luggage because "ramp was broken." No other ramps in Charlotte??
@SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!
@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
@USAirways to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,I just used the wrong name
@JetBlue on flight 622 from Nassau to JFK. Not showing Cancelled Flightled yet but assuming it will be? Any info?
@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here.
@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/QDlJHslOI5 #CheapFlights #FareCompare
@JetBlue But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service.
@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
@SouthwestAir #worstthingever 2days Late Flightr our lost bag was fedexed somewhere. Do you know where cause we don't &amp; it was delivered somewhere
@united thank you for following up!
@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
@JetBlue April 6th. Anything specific I should know for my first flight?
@united ouch not fair
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP
@JetBlue I'd go to Australia to enjoy the land down under! Always been on my bucket list! #FlyingItForward
@USAirways follow/dm please
@united Thank you for responding so promptly! I look forward to the 240 kms drive to the office to file a claim.
@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading.
@usairways #crew keeping safety top of mind in CLT. http://t.co/a0YoSJHZMc
@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?
@AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW...
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?
but why RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W0HOAewhwS
@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™
@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!
Really ? üòë‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/V5QWkYXSW6‚Äù
@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no...
@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
@JetBlue someone should screen what you play on your flights. http://t.co/tNY9uIpha5
@JetBlue boarding the back of the airplane first. Like a boss. #sosmart #jetblue #frequentflyerappreciates #alsoyayforsnacks
@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
@USAirways after sitting on the runway for 3 hours i had to leave the airport w/o my luggage. Is this ur 1st day??
@USAirways I was told a "return call" by a human
@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
@SouthwestAir Another great flight &amp; crew, Las Vegas-Chicago #3397. Thanks!
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@AmericanAir 30 minutes flight from OKC and then make us wait, 30 minutes cause the gate isn't empty.  #epicfail #poorplanning
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
@SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
@USAirways pilot says that we are going to take off in 10 minutes. So maybe the systems came back online?
@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
@USAirways nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time.
@USAirways that is certainly not the impression she's under.
@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab
@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
@AmericanAir yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
@SouthwestAir thanks for the great customer service today! üëçüëå
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
@AmericanAir and is there a delay on our connection to pns?
@USAirways  thanks I hope I get to my destination
@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with "issues"...
@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@AmericanAir After being patient about my "delayed" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@SouthwestAir better travel photos:My Kindle e-book Easy Tips guide http://t.co/7dM2J8H97M:http://t.co/xeDeckGMW5 http://t.co/frGhglMkqF
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated
@SouthwestAir great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. üòíüëé
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@JetBlue: DCA to Nantucket - Washington Business Journal http://t.co/ebxC94kFJD
@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@JetBlue is definitely my new favorite airline.
@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
@JetBlue How do I know if my flight was deemed a dark flight?
@JetBlue you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; "Anthony" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down.
@USAirways want to bump up my seet to first class for two Cancelled Flightlations in 24hrs?? what a joke
@SouthwestAir  I will dm you now
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!
@JetBlue gorgeous day, hope the flight back tomorrow AM is just as pleasant! Thanks
@JetBlue I know where you guys jet! LOL, but if you love me so much, help a brother out :) Hot weather, great nightlife, 2-3 hour flight
@united I wanna be grand staff
@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
@AmericanAir - yep , they've been good.  Now can you make that 1535 flight to mci wait just a tick....üòÉ
@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i
@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@united any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? :)))) my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!!
@JetBlue currently dancing in the terminal. love Stevie!
@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
@SouthwestAir Since when did it become ok for a passenger to save 3 rows of seats for people with a Late Flightr boarding position?how rude!
@VirginAmerica It's fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons iD is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them! it would be life changing to see them!
@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
@SouthwestAir Flight 4968 (N8325D) departs @MCO enroute to @NO_Airport http://t.co/fd4SnvKIeM
@VirginAmerica Adds Pillows Instead of Lie-Flat Seats in First Class Arms Race http://t.co/rGYwJBbhm4
@AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help
@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
@SouthwestAir finally through thx
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
@SouthwestAir Please explain to reps, ignoring a technical issue and passing the buck is not a good business model. Lucky limited to 140
@AmericanAir hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from Dublin???
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
@USAirways No US Air ppl anywhere in PHL directed stranded pax. Kudos to the PHL employees getting off work at midnight. Only help we got.
@united DM sent. Thanks so much for the strong customer service!!
@USAirways should look into better service‚úåÔ∏è
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighting my flight today because of weather in Dallas without being charged?
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@united Lost my wallet on flight 1007 yesterday from Houston to Bogota. Filled out your online form. No response yet.
@southwestair I've been on hold for 2 hours to reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flight for the morning. What gives? I need help NOW
@southwestair #netneutrality Nice to see you prioritize Internet traffic to your own streaming service over other web sites!
@VirginAmerica Anytime, sugafly.
@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
@JetBlue keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before
@USAirways - done :)
@SouthwestAir, answered right away for a new res, but can't rebook the people that were supposed to leave today? Worst customer service.
@SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds.
@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
@united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!
@JetBlue @vegecomgirl For me it‚Äôs not until 6/15.
@JetBlue Thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
@united this 2 hr delay is a vacation buzzkill
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
@SouthwestAir is really stepping up their "service"üê© http://t.co/VQTyza6Mzu
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply.
@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
@JetBlue  hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear..
@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
@JetBlue toss this ticket...it's great PR and I'm sure every college student following me will be willing to rock out wit too üëÄüëÄ
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@JetBlue the USA help line.  i accidentally booked a flight on a thursday instead of a wednesday and want to switch
@SouthwestAir would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@AmericanAir Understood. Integration takes time, but no excuse for poor customer service
@AmericanAir I'd like to explore both options, and what the cost might be to change the date and destination.
@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
@AmericanAir why is it from June 1 thru December 31 there are no bus/first milesaaver awards available from cun to nyc? #Explain #whyfly
@SouthwestAir I do need help Cancelled Flighting my flight back. Your calls times are ridiculous.
@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
@JetBlue you don't need to cut services, charge more and give a better flying experience. That's why I use jet blue in the first place
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)
@USAirways now over 2 hrs. Can't wait anymore. 2 hrs for nothing. Now what?? #frustrated #USAirways http://t.co/BuwjTVUWKM
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@AmericanAir no email no phone call no nothing. You've screwed with my flight and my family/Friends flights. You Cancelled Flighted reservations for
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
@JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
@JetBlue thanks
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@AmericanAir 3127. Just landed in LIT.
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
@SouthwestAir loving the boarding to go to Chicago #KeepItMovin'

@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!
@VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome

@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.

@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
@SouthwestAir why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today?
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream?
@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
@united OMG THANK Uüòªüòªüòª

@AmericanAir flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem?
@SouthwestAir your website has now reverted my 1st flight to only a 5-minute delay. But it's changed, so is that reliable information?
@USAirways thank you, but it says the website is down
@JetBlue need flight to ATH from PDX. Do you coordinate with other airlines?

@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
@USAirways @AmericanAir Just got off Int. Flight #799. Your Intentionally rude staff made for a horrible 8hr+ flight on an unsuitable plane.
@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them.
@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
@AmericanAir I DM'd you. Anything you can do?
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
@JetBlue no one yet but some, fl 8162
@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow.
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@SouthwestAir  I heard a rumor flight 898 was Cancelled Flightled.  Is this true?
@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways what is the baggage allowance on flights from Glasgow to the US?  Thanks
@united waiting 12 mins and counting to get through to Global Services....something going on?
@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
@CatfoodBeerGlue you'll enjoy this. ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2thC9RKURT‚Äù
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?
@JetBlue Boston gate C12
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
@AmericanAir @yvonneokaka When do I get my personal response and apology for your crew's having forgotten to load baggage onto my flight?
@USAirways is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger
@VirginAmerica I love this graphic. http://t.co/UT5GrRwAaA
@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@JetBlue that sucks. Oh well.
@USAirways You are 0 for 3 so far in on-time flights on this vacation.
@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
@JetBlue flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight
@USAirways, I know you're dealing with the weather, but @PHLAirport is a hot mess. Pls send reinforcements
@USAirways pilot for flight 729 didn't show until after departure ‚åöÔ∏è &amp; now there's a broken computer. Next time flying @United. #ALWAYSLate Flight
@AmericanAir .. UMM hello?
@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
@AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@AmericanAir My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I've been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help
@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!

@SouthwestAir I'm ready for #MayweatherPacquiao in Vegas May 2nd! http://t.co/8dQZlrJo9p
@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock
@USAirways I just hope that pilot had a good day off
@JetBlue No, he didn't have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep?
@SouthwestAir Had a great trip this past week to Vegas for work; and had this pic over the Southwest on Southwest! http://t.co/a3YCFlaLxV
@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
@USAirways Is there a phone line to call into that isn't being affected by "bad weather"? Trying to book a vacation, here... üëÄ
@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
@SouthwestAir - We left iPad in a seat pocket.  Filed lost item report. Received it exactly 1 week Late Flightr.  Is that a record?  #unbelievable
@JetBlue Jan 5? That's not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt
@SouthwestAir good to be back. See you all again in several weeks.
@SouthwestAir @TomVH just get the RR credit card and get the points of family that way
@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, "not yet located"?
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@united DM sent as requested. Make sure you follow back so you can DM me back. Thanks
@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.
@USAirways I appreciate that you actually monitor Twitter, so please  pass along my feedback. I've tried calling about 15 times in 4 days :(
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@SouthwestAir I'm upset because we were lied to. Was told ice on runway, but EVERY other carrier was able to fly. Airport confirmed no ice!
@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
@JetBlue deal!
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Congrats to these fans who are seeing #DestinationDragons in L.A.! SLC, you're next! http://t.co/YcCITaeP3S‚Äù Thanks again SW
@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù

@USAirways @AmericanAir taking off now. if I don't have a private jet to bora bora by the time I land, I'm calling Oprah
@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah "I" got it rebooked
@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible "provide a death certificate' policy
@JetBlue #kudos! And we're done and heading to warmer weather!
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to "Try again Late Flightr".
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed
@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@SouthwestAir Free TV watching Daytona 500! #Boss http://t.co/SbGBN7oUXy
@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff
@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
@AmericanAir daughter record loc. is KYBILC. She is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats, not across isle.
@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
@SouthwestAir @dultch97 that's horse radish üò§üê¥
@SouthwestAir LUVed the SJC gate 23 agent this am who boarded flight 372 to DAL. Didn't get his name. He represents your brand so well.
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
@SouthwestAir please....can I have the last tickets for me and my best friend to #DestinationDragons http://t.co/eQqi1nfSZh
@SouthwestAir this is ridiculous. It's been 2 hours on hold to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight.
@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
@USAirways Sadly I'm currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can.
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ
@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@JetBlue if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo http://t.co/JI7xkS2jkk
@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flighted, two hours on hold. Then it just hangs up! A little help here? -thx
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU for finally making your boarding passes work with passbook
@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
Why ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/a7NvbJ8ipx‚Äù
@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.
@united tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it.
@united The link in the message I was replying to. #3thparty #ITproblems
@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't.
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
@USAirways flight 2022 out of Phil, no update and was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago.  Sitting in airport, wondering#irritated

@USAirways thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp; boots count as 1. Teach your mgr who didn't know

@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JetBlue your blue helped bring out the color of my eyes. And I promise I didn't eat all the free snacks.
@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ

@AmericanAir trying to get thru to agent since last night b/c AA changed our flight to 2 days from now. Infuriating! We need to get to SEA!
@JetBlue Why doesn't your "Best Fare Finder" work?

@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@AmericanAir I am traveling from AUH to IAD via etihad and then from IAD to DFW via AA. Will I be able to retrieve my checked bag in IAD?

@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank

@AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn‚Äôt call back. #help
@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.

@SouthwestAir Trying to add my dog on the flight but can't get through.
@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
. @united sad that you don't think it is important to resolve your client facing team that behaves disgraceful
@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
@SouthwestAir Salted or honey roasted? I vote to bring back the salted peanuts. I dread a year of the honey roasted!üòñ http://t.co/RHw78ktQFO
@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was "Inop". I love a good abbreve.
@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!

@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp; ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay.
@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com

@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good.
@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst
@united I'll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast RT again.
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
@united I Want a Plane dad
@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
@USAirways My bags were supposed to be delivered to NYC last night (missing since Thurs) but are not here. Can someone call me?
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@united thanks
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?
@USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home üë†üë†üë† (3 heel clicks)
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@VirginAmerica Very nicely done. üëè
@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd...
@USAirways no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways
@JetBlue No worries. Time flew in the terminal and now we're taking off. Thanks again!
@SouthwestAir @JohnWayneAir Thank you both very much!!
‚Äú@VirginAmerica:You've met your match.Got status on another airline? Upgrade : http://t.co/H952rDKTqy‚Äù @asarco_ES_ar ? üôâ
@AmericanAir i need someone to help me out
@ods1819 aren't you glad this isn't you RT @AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/HEpkNpuzwU
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
@USAirways what does "your reservation is 'out of sync.'" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up
@SouthwestAir how it feels on flight 4251 http://t.co/JM8gQ1KGrF
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines
@JetBlue They did not have any &amp; asked if I wanted tea. How do you have tea&amp;not coffee? I'm a gold on United &amp; coffee I nvr think 2x about
@VirginAmerica Nice, Lofty View @flyLAXairport. #SilverStatus http://t.co/F4Tp0dAwbd
@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again
@USAirways I better get a free flight
@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
@SouthwestAir  how do you get one?
@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
@USAirways thank you! I will be calling you! #CheapOairChat
@USAirways flt 470 Tampa to CLT is very Late Flight gonna miss conn to BOS what can you do?
@SouthwestAir Yes, please.
@USAirways now on hold for 2 hrs 20 min. This is ridiculous
@SouthwestAir are ur flight still Cancelled Flight from nashville tn today and tomorrow to Dallas TX? I been waiting on phone to ur office for 40 min.
@JetBlue is the greatest airline ever üíï‚úàÔ∏èüí∫ #TrueBluePoints #jetbluemember
@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.
@united exactly
@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@united My bag reference ID number is IND43728M. Thanks for looking at it.
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@united  4348 soon going to have more wait time for a gate, in empty MSP airport than it was in flight  50 min and still counting...
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.
@SouthwestAir I was not the one traveling. I was asking for my sister who was waiting on my nephew in Midland...flight eventually landed
@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@JetBlue @KleinErin Hi! Know a pastor or homeschool mom who might like SpiritED? Have 'em contact me on Prefundia:http://t.co/jRbZLHRW7y
@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@USAirways your customer service at CLT is terrible!!! My flight was delayed from JFK for 2 hours!  Get to CLT to horrid customer service!
@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers.
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
@united 777 from SFO to HNL with ZERO entertainment systems???!!!#youareonyourown
@USAirways Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ‚§µ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy
@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
@JetBlue That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.
@USAirways please please please let my plane back to the gate so I can get off as I will miss connection due to CLT closing. 2034
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
@VirginAmerica thank you for checking in. tickets are purchased and customer is happy ;-)
@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
@JetBlue Thank you. I really would have preferred Jet Blue. You guys have the best seats in the business.
@USAirways @AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!
@SouthwestAir sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.
@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons #DestinationDragons Any tix to spare? I wanna go see the show on Friday in LA with my friend @HayleyMad!
@USAirways standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days.
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@USAirways how are you even still in business? i have been trying to call for hours. this is pathetic.
@united same day flights
@united ha, this happened 10 years ago. i haven't flown with you since.
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
@AmericanAir Reebooked for tomorrow in AA 1389 LV-DFW at 810 am arriving 12.50pm; still open this flight?
@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher
@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
@VirginAmerica heyyyy guyyyys.. been trying to get through for an hour. can someone call me please? :/
@SouthwestAir I understand. Wonderful "Miriam" in customer service who was able to reroute me... Got any rental car discounts?
@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
@SouthwestAir no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@USAirways it's unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!!
@united captain "on behalf of the front office, welcome on board.".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain
@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines
@SouthwestAir want to pick up a customer from @SpiritAirlines sign me up üôåüòè
@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an "UNMET ARRIVAL"!!
@AmericanAir I am going to keep these tweets coming till AA does something...which I know is nothing..hoping I go way...not likely.
@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me
@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@SouthwestAir no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times. Can you assist in Cancelled Flighting reservation?
@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
@united Very good flight, thank you!
@SouthwestAir I always brag about ur service, but very disappointed today. Apparently I'll be sleeping on floor of Dallas airport tonight üëé
@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
@SouthwestAir lol I already am ! I am a card member as well too lol i enjoy flying with you Guys
@AmericanAir yes yes yes,so glad to be headed home!
@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning.
@SouthwestAir How's Dallas incoming looking? I'm scheduled to fly in at 10:30 and wondering if I'll be stuck in St. Louis instead.
@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire
@united thanks we'll be in touch!
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@JetBlue do you have a waiver for NY weather today?
@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
@USAirways thank you!!
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
@SouthwestAir because according to the flight attendant my husband doesn't talk english, when the fact is that he understand and talks it
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
@AmericanAir thank you for responding rather quickly btw
@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
@AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up.
@united Hi, I read there are weather warnings on the East Coast of the US. Would a flight from LHR to SFO be affected?
@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today
@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems
@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
@AmericanAir Trying to make an online Flight Booking Problems one way from Barbados -NYC but wont let me as says I need a Barbados CC...why??!
@USAirways what's the deal with the flight computer network?
@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
@JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
@USAirways your team member at DCA- Tamara R. is her name was awesome. You should have more employees like her!
@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
@AmericanAir no. Prebook flight for wife's 40th bday in NO. I recently have had surgery and can't travel. Won't let another go in my place
I ‚ù§Ô∏è flying @VirginAmerica. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@JetBlue thanks for your prompt response. I know you put safety first. Unfortunately will hit freezing rain/sleet on ride home.
@SouthwestAir tried online and told I must call b/c of modifications to my reservation. Been on hold for almost 2 hours.
@JetBlue is yr site having trouble for mobile check in ?
@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
@united thanks for more timely updates.
@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero.  Got my husband back thru security to retrieve his cellphone in Austin. Terry (#85832) You Rock!

@SouthwestAir I have the DM from @SouthwestVerity if needed
@SouthwestAir been on hold  for 2 1/2 hrs. Can't get 2 airport 4 flight icy country backroads! Help pls? Can a human answer? #BNA
@USAirways Its not just PHL, at BTV today made to deplane because "it's Sunday and we don't know if maintenance will be available"
@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
@USAirways it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++
@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
@USAirways always letting me down. üëä
@SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@USAirways I have been I hold for 40 min. My 5:50 flight just got Cancelled Flightled and rescheduled for Monday. This is unacceptable!
@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
@JetBlue thanks. I chatted with a nice fella about it and he gave me the lowdown.
@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.
@SouthwestAir adding direct flights from #Columbus to #Oakland, @BostonLogan http://t.co/p8Vcz4XTHM via @DispatchAlerts

@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
@AmericanAir ‚Ä¶ Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
@USAirways my option is to use twitter. Most of the people working for u have no clue what they do. they tell you to go to A4 but its b16
@AmericanAir flight was 2488 out of EWR STOP AT DALLAS THEN TO LA. I need to be in la tonight!
@JetBlue thanks! I only loose 'em at airports...1st time we found it. I think @fitbit needs to make flexes that stay on when carrying bags!
@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald
@SouthwestAir i cant look up my confirmation number at the moment on mobile. the email is no longer in my inbox

@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@USAirways on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email

@AmericanAir  They said it works 80-90% of the time, DFW security entrance C26. Before/after pre-check, whereas I paid for the service.
@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?

@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.

@united or did you mean 24-26?
@JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should

@SouthwestAir Can you link the article where it says the routes and what times the routes are likely to be? Like TUL-DAL 1:00PM - 7 None
@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight.
@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons please help me and my best friend get tickets to #DestinationDragons we have so much to thank them for....
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways on the phone now. looks like global
@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
@united yep‚Äîused that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, ‚Äúthank you for submitting your request‚Äù
@SouthwestAir my father was kind enough to offer to pay for a hotel, but I can't use this coupon if he pays from FL. no help?
@JetBlue hey, so, Dre at Seatac check in needs a raise, stat. Dude gave me amazing customer service and made me feel valued. üëç
BLOCK ME BIKE RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2z3hGqPRSG
@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the "inflight wifi" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@southwestair Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful.
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@AmericanAir guarantee no retribution? If so, I'd be glad to share.
@SouthwestAir  I got rebooked for tomorrow
@USAirways on hold 2.5 hrs trying to reschedule our flight. Can anyone there please help us?
@united you can't claim "weather" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
@SouthwestAir So I guess you can get to the airport too early!  Need to wait 10mins to checkin. Really?
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@AmericanAir "We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight" is ridiculous.
@united ruined my day &amp; start trip SFO to GIG. both legs changed, lost my paid upgrade &amp; 200 1st class seat &amp; moved me from Econ + to Econ
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
@SouthwestAir Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;)
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @mwangbickler We apologize for your frustrations, Michael. Have you been rebooked?‚Äù -got call back after 10 hours. Bad.
@SouthwestAir done
@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT.
@USAirways Three hour delay from Miami to London.  None of the other flights today are delayed. Put me on another flight!
@JetBlue Third flight in a row for my wife with her TV not working...
@SouthwestAir been holding for 1 hour and 10 minutes. To rebook Cancelled Flightlation.You guys need more help!
@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day
@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@united: "Left gate 5 minutes early." My thoughts: "That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour." #comeonpeople
@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
@SouthwestAir rules.
@JetBlue making a bad situation worse. Cancelled Flighted flight, making us stay overnight in SXM. Won't provide vouchers to stay in a different hotel
@AmericanAir upgraded to 1st class. Inquired about red wine.  "Sauvignon blanc &amp; I can't pronounce the other one."  Couldn't describe...
@USAirways what's your pet policy?
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@AmericanAir Please try it yourself - call 1-800-433-7300 and see what happens... then you'll understand.  #allrepresentativesbusy #nooption

@SouthwestAir I'll have to drop by next time I visit!
Just in case you needed confirmation that "on fleek" is dead &amp; gone. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/G4O6yX7TMJ
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@JetBlue knew that ... has to be done at the Gate correct? If so what time does gate open

@SouthwestAir great flight got us back on time!  Thanks
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
@AmericanAir sounding like they just got bitch-slapped by @juliasinton948
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
Nice RT @VirginAmerica: Vibe with the moodlight from takeoff to touchdown. #MoodlitMonday #ScienceBehindTheExperience http://t.co/Y7O0uNxTQP

@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
@united well played, ^LO.
@USAirways Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE.
@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids, need to be certain. Thx
@AmericanAir SJC-&gt;LAX. After the fourth time, I gave up!
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough
@AmericanAir yes. No one is answering and I'm on a train
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help?
@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!
@JetBlue just DMed. thanks so much for addressing this so quickly.
@united Filled in the form you sent the link to on 29.1.15 and then either 9 or 10.2.15
@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out.
@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
@JetBlue may I check my 17-month-old child's fold-up crib for free on my flight tomorrow, similar to your policy for infant car seats?
@AmericanAir not anymore.
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@SouthwestAir Not possible to carry-on and put in a closet/overhead? Had success doing that with other airlines. Thanks
@AmericanAir I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@USAirways Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica
@JetBlue hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan üå¥
@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
@JetBlue and have empty "help" desks
@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you "hope" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you.
@SouthwestAir My flight to KC has been Cancelled Flighted and the next available isn't till Tuesday?! What am I supposed to do for 3 nights?????
@SouthwestAir is the best airline hands down. Amazing customer service, bags free and affordable flights. #happycamper
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@JetBlue @SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica @AmericanAirBR download jeokoo the American app for air travelers

@JetBlue Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen!
@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
.@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded...
@SouthwestAir @Kaneshow @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv THIS IS EVERYTHING... now, return that jet so we can go to Miami!
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice

.@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience
@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.

@JetBlue thank you for taking care of me with a drink since my in-flight entertainment wasn't working #goodcustomerservice
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.

@JetBlue when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt;
@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@AmericanAir - I am Platinum.  I am flying USAir and they have stranded me in CLT.  Not answering phones. Did not rebook me.  Please help?

@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying "standby"
@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...

@USAirways ... What's going on at @PHLAirport ?!  I've been sitting at the gate for 45minutes.
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@united that's not even an apology
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.

@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
@united why do you bother surveying me!
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@united I have a flight from omaha to chicago (en route to NYC) and they are seating me and my partner separate, please fix this res# ILC0HP
@VirginAmerica Are the hours of operation for the Club at SFO that are posted online current?
@USAirways My Flight Booking Problems C68LD9 just times out when I select it under Manage My Flight Booking Problems for months now. I have emailed but no response. Help?
Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors ‚Äú@united: We‚Äôre bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"
@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
@southwestair Amazing view on the approach to LAX tonight. http://t.co/a68d5fULmH
@united good to know you will open the closed doors for "premier passengers" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed.
@SouthwestAir My son's flight was Cancelled Flightled today. I was on hold 2+ hours to no avail. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
@JetBlue Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
@AmericanAir Retrain in Customer Service first, make proper adjustments when Cancelled Flightling flights. Own up to your Mistakes.
@USAirways on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money
@SouthwestAir finally!
@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
@SouthwestAir won't let me send a DM because they don't follow me.. #lovedflyingwiththem #notanymore #wrong #badpolicy
@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note.
@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
@united it can't be delivered. It has to be held there for me to cross the border to pick up. Please don't try to deliver.
@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver memberüòí
@AmericanAir Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics...
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
@VirginAmerica View of downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign, and beyond that rain in the mountains! http://t.co/Dw5nf0ibtr
@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
@USAirways Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!?
@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow has already been Cancelled Flightled, what do I do now?
@SouthwestAir @travelportland welcome to Portland. Sun, Mt hood and Southwest. http://t.co/y3SAHVX3Zk
@united any solutions?
@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
