@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
@VirginAmerica Giants and Virgin America. A match made in heaven.

@USAirways Still waiting for another crew member. #cabinfever
@VirginAmerica Really missed a prime opportunity for Men Without Hats parody, there. https://t.co/mWpG7grEZP
@USAirways flight today showing on time online, not able to check in. Called &amp; told was Cancelled Flightled, put on hold over an hr ago. Help?
@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
@AmericanAir my mom’s flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it’s been 4. I need to go to bed!
@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
@AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can't tell me where it is. I've lost $1000 of stuff :( #AmericanAirlines #unamericanairlines
@SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@SouthwestAir well I'm not sure what there is you can do.  The bad experience had already been had
@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!
@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls!
@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
@USAirways thanks to the whole team for an on-time flight despite inclement weather http://t.co/eQePkkPSXM
@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good
@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks
@JetBlue what can I say, I'm #LostinLove w/our #brandmance https://t.co/Bzwgp7aDVE #wemosaictogether #Mint #Love
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
@AmericanAir @USAirways "but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated" {sigh}
@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@united I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!
@AmericanAir awesome! Thx
@JetBlue when are you going to get wifi on your planes?
@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@VirginAmerica You should still develop an app - then you will be my favorite airline.
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help
@SouthwestAir can take u to Midway-Chicago March 8th-April 6th. Can't make it then? @AmericanAir can get u to @fly2ohare year round. #FlyPBI
@SouthwestAir It was never really "lost" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@USAirways 2nd plane forced to get off due to mech and wait for 3rd need housing and meals in STT need help b4 we arrive at STT please
@JetBlue Gotcha... thanks for the update. I'm ready to go whenever you are :) Enjoy your evening.
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5xGnyHGAFz” this is what I hate
@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.
@united it sucks not having the money to book a flight to see the love of my life. 2600 miles away.
@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?
@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
@JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer’s vacation. it was joke watching those “we care thanks for choosing us” videos
@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@USAirways - I'm currently missing a basketball game due to your lost bag policy #terribleservice #wheresmyrefund
@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate.
@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
@AmericanAir It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation.
@united That's called throwing "loyalty" out the window and trying to give less awards.
@SouthwestAir How can we get refund instead of credit for flight that you Cancelled Flightled? We couldn't switch to a flight tomorrow.
@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@USAirways issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities
@SouthwestAir damn weather messing up everything #serenitynow
@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
@USAirways thx 4 replying. After trying 2 get thru many times, &amp; v-mail or people hanging up on, us we talked 2 tech...cont'd
@united thx. Come hell or high water...
@AmericanAir thanks for keeping us safe
@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
@SouthwestAir hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
@USAirways On re-accommodation number Lisa (Liza?) in Raleigh was very helpful
@USAirways - I wouldn't need to wait on hold for 6+ hours if your website worked correctly - please respond!
@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best
@USAirways to CLT from JFK nasty planes, dirty seats &amp; floors, rude flight attendants- hopefully AA can get you cleaned up #disgusting #vile
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
@SouthwestAir @PaytonTaylor129 I love Southwest and Payton Taylor!
@united your Airbus a320 seats are awful. They don't recline.
.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.
@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
@SouthwestAir Thx for your quick response and action! bf will make good use of the voucher #satisfied #happycustomer
@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
@virginamerica Digging the swanky pink mood lighting during the flight from NYC to SFO.  Just needs a cabaret singer.  Think about it!
@united Was on NH10 on United ticket, rerouted to IAD due to weather in JFK. Can you get us home on United 5713 or 3277?
@JetBlue Spent most of the winter in NNY with Mom,  JetBlue will take me home to FL via BOS on Mon. Miss hubby, kitties, warm #countingdown
@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering...
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@AmericanAir Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... http://t.co/DQnn0Rf1V8
@JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@SouthwestAir any word when the customer relations department will open back up?
@USAirways Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF http://t.co/WXowZhpgfL
@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
@SouthwestAir Is there any chance I can get tickets for the Vegas stop? I missed my chance to enter the contest but I love ID to death !
@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
@SouthwestAir don't you think a 4hr wait time to speak to an actual agent is ridiculous?! My flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning! #Getyourlife
@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.#flyunited
@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.
@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
@malhoit at least you got a response from @AmericanAir via Twitter. I went 0 for 2 yesterday.
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks.
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines.
@USAirways Handled. I found tkt on floor dropped by someone. No way - I’m in wheelchair - to get to podium.
@SouthwestAir- Wife's RR pts expired a few days ago, were planning on Flight Booking Problems trip today. Anything you can do for us? On a tight budget...
@united Thank you!! 😊
@USAirways rebooked me after i missed my flight..never called me and i didnt check my email.  I (cont) http://t.co/uTfDhxa8pU
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@AmericanAir received an email requesting I call about a res. but I keep getting kicked off of your phone system. Help?
@USAirways i want an Icecream baby...
@SouthwestAir still planing on flights into Dal? We are trying to fly in tomorrow from lax
“@JetBlue: @dlewis2412 Sorry! Please ask Inflght if there is an open seat you can move to.” Will do!
@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.
@AmericanAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24?
@united one last thing....United club crackers...nabisco?? Where are the Pepperidge Farms?
@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
@JetBlue I'm sick of y'all.
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@JetBlue Headphone jack not working on my flight.
@JetBlue Phew!! Did it!! (Pant. Wheeze) http://t.co/ZPZ78POeON
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@SouthwestAir Got it covered. Thanks!
@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
@USAirways printer problems causing us to sit on the runway for 45 mins. Get it together.
@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flightled due to "weather conditions" in arrival city. Uh...I don't think so.
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@JetBlue Anywhere warm cause its freezing in NYC
@SouthwestAir - 800 is not int'l friendly
@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
@VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home!
@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
@JetBlue where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@VirginAmerica do you miss me? Don't worry we'll be together very soon.
@jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet.
@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
@SouthwestAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
@AmericanAir thanks
@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
@VirginAmerica posts second consecutive full-year net profit - @ATWOnline http://t.co/tvB5zbzVhg
@united delayed another hour
@USAirways flights &amp; "customer relations" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE
@AmericanAir Nicest people ever flight to Chicago.Thanks David Deane &amp; Norma Sedholm for making me feel comfortable ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/clu5pdPrHP” :(
@USAirways HELP! It says "the payment is denied" but my money has been taken out of my bank?  And it says I have no trips coming up??
@SouthwestAir what's up with these delays?! Throw some priority boarding my way &amp; I'll forgive you!! 👍 #southwest #southwestairlines
@united we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for #charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
@united In 2015, United is "unable" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@SouthwestAir My wife needs help. She is stranded in Chicago and can't get out until Monday. They won't find her bag because volume too high
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
@SouthwestAir When do you all expect to open the reservation through November?
@USAirways little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete.
@USAirways No I need the corporate office number please as that is who is dealing with this for me. It's a 480 number.
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
@JetBlue good to hear. Thx for being responsive.
@SouthwestAir  If you'd love to see more girls get inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free Albuquerque event. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh
@united I filled out the form but I haven’t received any sort of email confirmation that it’s been received. Is that normal?
@USAirways I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial?
@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
@VirginAmerica my goodness your people @love field are amazing under pressure ❤️from Texas #beatstheothers in crisis Please fly me to NY
@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
@USAirways does anyone actually work at the dividend miles department? http://t.co/BgtJFmnEOT
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@USAirways Have you issued a Memphis travel advisory for tomorrow? Winter weather coming through now.
@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
@USAirways @AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. 😭😭
@USAirways how do you lose a pilot????
@AmericanAir all good! I'm catching the 11:10p flight tonight. Thanks for the response.
@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
@united Do you mean "fortunately"? I don't want my flight to be affected! 😉
@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure.
@VirginAmerica I need you to follow back in order to DM.
@JetBlue Airways to continue 'various commercial relationships' with #Lufthansa ... - @CAPA_Aviation http://t.co/o5sifHp4RT
@VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???
@SouthwestAir Making Miracles again! The customer service department gave me by far one of the friendliest phone calls ever. #wheelsup
@SouthwestAir have five people shown up yet
@SouthwestAir    Promotion e-mail today (Vegas and Jamaica) has a defective link for the Vegas sweepstakes...it times out with error.
@AmericanAir I love the Admiral Clubs! Thanks, hey can you follow me?
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/pr3OeBC2N2” lol wut?
@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still "Now Boarding"...
@united -today the staff @ MSP took customer service to a new level. My father passed away last night &amp; you helped me get home today! Thanks
Currently on @JetBlue, my new robotic love-doll. Reminded heavily of @pattonoswalt's bit about them-hence an excuse to say "huxleyesque."
@VirginAmerica kinda sucked my earphone jack didn't work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers
@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
@united I'll make sure he's done that. Thanks for the help. This is a huge race for him and just trying to make sure it goes smoothly. Peace
@USAirways This is the last time I use your airline. I promise that!
@AmericanAir  beyond frustrated with no call back from auto hold or whatever you call it. Entered my number at 11:30 CST, still no call 2:26
@USAirways why are your customer service department so intent on ignoring my emails and queries? #badservice #usairways
@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@united ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I'm kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either.
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
@USAirways What's the seat assignment policy? Why let us choose a seat only to change it on us two weeks Late Flightr?
@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
@AmericanAir Yes, thanks I found those, didn't see the gray tab at first :)
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@JetBlue Can I bring a compact folding chair like this in a checked bag? http://t.co/9nivw9ftZw
@SouthwestAir thanks I think we've got it figured out
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir  traveling 2bwi nMaryland 2morrw any chance the flight being Cancelled Flightled to inclement weather? Any chance can get earlier flight
@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue
@united I need help with a missing bag.
@USAirways to a booked hotel for the night so I had to find him a room at midnight. Then say his bags will be on the plane, but can't (2/3)
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@SouthwestAir briughy me to @ComClassic, #AIF2015 &amp; so much more with the #agcommunity
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
@AmericanAir We did talk with Delta for about hour over phone, and I got a number from Delta that they asked to give to AA, which I did.
@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
@JetBlue can't change it. True blue points and I can't get to a phone
@VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin
@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
@JetBlue is gettin fancy! #Mint #LieFlat Nice work on the menu @Saxonandparole #LobsterMac #BloodyMary #JetSetter http://t.co/zf5wjgtXzT

@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
@USAirways @AmericanAir are u paying incedentals? #noworstairline
@SouthwestAir How? It is not possible to call SWA on the phone. You put me on hold for an hour and then cut me off.
@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?

@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@SouthwestAir, I really appreciate you all's #BHM commercial that aired today during @BET's #BookofNegroes

@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark
@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
@united @ShulemStern @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate
@SouthwestAir can you show me some luv?Its 9 degrees and all this snow but Imdetermined to go to #DestinationDragons http://t.co/oXm6cWGaB7
@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
@USAirways at least they make you run so you want yo buy this fresh diet coke...nice bizness plan. Its all about marketing right?
@USAirways thanks :)
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying

@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
@USAirways I need an actual person in customer relations for a refund. What # can I call? I will dispute this charge on my credit card.
@SouthwestAir just do it that easy
Bruh “@VirginAmerica: @giannilee Turn down for what. #VXSafetyDance”
@AmericanAir u cant spell airline and I trusted you to get me home on time and safe you are the worst #gobankrupt http://t.co/aM9CuieWO4
@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
@JetBlue My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if "the passengers really knew what was going on" and the attendant said no.
@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos.
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@VirginAmerica - can you tweet me the Cancelled Flight/chng fee for a flight? or can I rebook under one of your affiliates? If so, who are afiliates?
@AmericanAir Thank you.
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was
@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted, headed to Houston, delayed, now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin
@united @parryaftab done thnx
@SouthwestAir You need to be more accommodating to your loyal customers. Not happy now!
@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove #whybeAAFF?
@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@AmericanAir do you still use DC9's?
@SouthwestAir Ive had on an airline. Everyone else has been great but she soured the whole experience for me. Hope she's not there next time
@SouthwestAir we're flying out tomorrow! PLEASE DONT Cancelled Flight!! Lol 😜✈️
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
@USAirways - have dinner reservations in a few minutes -- and I've been trying to get through to you since BREAKFAST. #onholdwith
@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
@AmericanAir  please call us back to rebook!!! 7403607771. We need to get back to Columbus!!!!!! Please help
@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
@united  Thank you for a wonderful global first class flight on your 777 to FRA. Great service. (cont) http://t.co/46n9kDcsxU
@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
@SouthwestAir What do you call that??!!
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@AmericanAir not having pillows or blankets or a flight home for 40 people does bad things to my hair
@USAirways @AmericanAir Almost half hour on hold.  My cell phone battery is dying.  Thanks for your loyalty from a "Platinum" member
@USAirways 1 hour and counting on hold :( why? http://t.co/clOB5qwMXR
@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
At the airport ready to get this @JetBlue red eye going.... Soooooo sleepy.  #NoPlaceLikeHome #eventhoughits2degreesathome
@VirginAmerica I have no interesting flying with you after this. I will Cancelled Flight my next four flights I planned.#neverflyvirginforbusiness
@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way.
@AmericanAir What are Preferred Seats?
@VirginAmerica when are you flying to hawaii
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@USAirways nope not yet...
@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths
@USAirways lol thanks to you we had to switch to American http://t.co/Sl6BDRXfN8
@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
@SouthwestAir when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM?
@JetBlue Hawaii what deals u have for me
@SouthwestAir could care more about their customer, if there is a reasonable request :(
@USAirways thank you for the apology
@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?
@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service
@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
@JetBlue my mom wanted me to change her seat along with my sister, but their two different reservations and idk
@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!
@USAirways one question. Can I book one way tickets with award travel/points
@SouthwestAir yes can do
@AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@JetBlue I would fly somewhere hotter then here. Puerto Rico here I come. Lol
@USAirways so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ✈ #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense!
@southwestair is your companion pass broken today? purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS (SW900001-vyiL1XKlROG24fS-918j_A)
@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold with international award reservations for almost 2 hours. 800-433-7300 keeps calling me. what is going on?
@USAirways through, can you confirm that I haven't been charged?
@VirginAmerica is that #thestarter??😁
@united Thanks!
@JetBlue This could be the beginning of a BLUEtiful relationship :) #lifeneedsfrosting
@VirginAmerica wow this just blew my mind
@AmericanAir My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I'm still not sure whose final carrier is referred to.
@USAirways sorry, we are in Philly. Should've told you that.
@USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids
@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed
@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@united it's amazing really.
@united you a bish
@AmericanAir are flights from Pensacola fl delayed flight 3670
@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!
@JetBlue Not trying to make you look bad, on your website it says: "Due to weather in the Charleston, NC" Its actually in SC, not NC
@USAirways is a DM possible if you aren't following me?
@SouthwestAir Hi there! I just got my known traveler# and would like to add it to a flight that I already purchased. What's my best option?
@JetBlue thanks to you customers like me stay loyal. From check in to landing.
@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
@SouthwestAir Finally got me home #BNASnow
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@united @reebok @rockinwellness @ Denver International Airport https://t.co/tKVmHBkeC3
@AmericanAir you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets
@united maybe on my return trip 👍
@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!
@SouthwestAir Hi! Thanks! Do you have an exact link to that specific page on your site you can share - or is it under "Flight Status":? Thx!
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
@SouthwestAir flight to PHL from FLL Cancelled Flighted 2/21 no flight available until 2/24 done with SW. They are a pain to deal with
@USAirways JUST LANDED flight 545. Any chance of making flight 5530 Phoenix to AUS
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@SouthwestAir had a great flight to and from Cabo last week with my family #smoothflight #frequentflyer
@JetBlue minutes to spare.
@SouthwestAir plane switch on 636 meant A= back of plane #disappointed
@JetBlue Hopefully next time! Can I send you my future itineraries so the next one can be planned when I'm there? 😂😂
@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...✈️
@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
@JetBlue what are the chances of one of your flights leaving at 6am out of Newark nj being Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
@JetBlue @ProfessorpaUL15 Always happy to help!
@JetBlue how can we get help with a hotel we booked with you and are having issues with.
@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?
@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
X__x RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/xxppZo88j1
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@JetBlue is bag check cut off 30 minutes before the original departure time or the estimated time shown online?
@SouthwestAir How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card!
@USAirways Good morning.
❤️❤️❤️“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/UHUmAskLdv”
@USAirways I can't wait for the @nytimes and @WSJ to find out how poorly @USAirways handled this situation. #shameful http://t.co/HHOxQPsUbA
@JetBlue Washington DC (:
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@JetBlue it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt.
@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
@united since I have an international connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!
@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly.
@SouthwestAir Thx for the GRAND view today! FLT 3825 SEATAC to PHX. #GrandCanyon #Arizona #Wow #Love #Photography http://t.co/D7pQOUAtdF
@SouthwestAir Can I book a flight on my own and get reimbursed by you?
@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
@SouthwestAir   Happily, flight 1625 was not delayed when a cockpit visit blew my four-yr-old's mind. Thanks, Cap'n! http://t.co/C8mqEzXVdH
@SouthwestAir will you please tell me if I'll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I've been tryin for 3 days now to leave
@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
@SouthwestAir Once again, I was able to change my flight without any fees... oh and the two free checked bags.  Best airline ever.
@SouthwestAir to start 2xdaily #B737-700 flights from #Columbus OH to #Boston @BostonLogan on 8AUG #avgeek
@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said "we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch"!
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@SouthwestAir I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading.
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united Will have to try standby in Denver tonight or will have to Cancelled Flight father son trip till next year. Thx for trying.
@JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago.
@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
@united yes to more food! Add some gluten free options while you're at it
@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here's hoping @united wakes up
@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
@SouthwestAir Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/v4ZVUGMkJw
@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
@SouthwestAir not sure I can trust a statement with that many small numbers above words. http://t.co/o3sRL1hfho
@AmericanAir I have almost 3 million miles w u so I am loyal to u.  When r u going to reciprocate?  What a joke
@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@SouthwestAir today you sporadically changed my flight departure 5 times &amp; left two hours Late Flight. Uncharacteristic of u http://t.co/TXhYJ40llG
@USAirways @corybronze  INCONVENIENCE? Are you people freaking nuts? This guy has TWO KIDS WITH HIM and you STRAND him in an airport! #FAIL
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
LMAO “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/aIyC9WV5oq”
@AmericanAir the dinner and called me "hon". Not the service I would expect from 1st class.  #disappointed
@united Also, group 5 is total BS.
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. 😒
@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!
@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
@USAirways thanks.
@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
@USAirways still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta?
@AmericanAir THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP!  :P You guys are the best.  #americanairlines #americanair
@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
@united we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you!
@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
@AmericanAir you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
@VirginAmerica shares up on 4Q results - @iol http://t.co/XZ6qeG3nef
@JetBlue why bro
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@SouthwestAir the wait for the bags is longer than the actual flight.
@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
@SouthwestAir Flt 463 San Jose, CA -&gt; Denver, CO. Delayed 2 hrs but easily best flight + touchdown in all my years flying. Keep it up!
@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!
YASSSSS. Da Fuccc- RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/oAJ5mnuchA
@united Thank you.
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
@united met with agent. All taken care of. Thx for reply
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@SouthwestAir Awwweesssooomee!
@SouthwestAir Do you have childrens rates for flights?
@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
@JetBlue @MrJustyn I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing.
@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area.
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
#Real RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ERzht75kqZ
@USAirways great, thank you!
@united no wifi on flight ua688. SF to ORD. Really?  Wow
@JetBlue it was but obviously it wasn't linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it.
@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?
@SouthwestAir give me tickets to the atlanta show and I'll roadtrip from Canada!! Deal? 😆
@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,
@AmericanAir Im trying to call and book a reward ticket on one world partners but your automated system wont let me talk to any1.  Great job
@SouthwestAir the ball has been dropped. My snowboard will not be making it to my destination. #totalfail #letdown
@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
@JetBlue 1st flight of the morning, flying with a toddler. Will the plane be heated to a comfortable temp before boarding starts. #ItsCold
@JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it
@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
@AmericanAir yes called your UK number on skype…well worth the $.50.  i recommend others do the same.
@SouthwestAir can you help
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@americanair Greatest Newark Gate Agents ever: David Deane, Norma Sedholm and Luz Calderon just made me feel like a king. #AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is "No". :(
@JetBlue Happy Anniversary!! It's hard to believe you're 15!! You're so young!
@AmericanAir yes they do http://t.co/wCSAZZQPae
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@JetBlue awesome, thanks!
@SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd?
@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
@SouthwestAir You officially have the worst customer service of any airline I've ever dealt with. #southwestairlines #poor
@united But thanks for asking
@united thank you!
@SouthwestAir thanks connection thru Nashville have A1 boarding pass get to Dallas gate boarding 40 min before flt get end of B group
@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
@united any updates with the DOT looking at the united fares from London to the US from last week?
@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
@USAirways so you're going to make me wait that long on the phone line when you can help me? # that's part of the problem
@AmericanAir We've 15 official complaints signed by #AmericanAirlines Lima supervisor. Customer Relations pls compensate 4 the 10-hour delay
@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
@AmericanAir @USAirways She's on Manch to Charlotte Fl 4628 Told her she could get on a 4pm flight to West Palm Beach. Nothing earlier?
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@united - vacation days: relevant, Ritz in PR for the night: $700, losing a day to idiots and sleeping at the Newark ramada; #priceless
@USAirways thanks for Cancelled Flighting flight 5097 today. Now missing required training. Not a happy customer.
@SouthwestAir Barzegar charges tourists 700 euros [!] a night for their stay in the tent village he runs. http://t.co/igSVzvrbbN
@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@USAirways Eh, it happens. I think I'll survive. 😉 Thanks!
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@SouthwestAir MCO-&gt;DCA flight almost full of people screwed by the MSY-DCA Cancelled Flightation. @united and @USAirways didn't Cancelled Flight. SWA=mistake.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir I need Imagine Dragons like I need air..... PLEASE HOOM ME UP FOR THE VEGAS SHOW ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@AmericanAir we then had to deplane, and change planes.
@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available
@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport
@SouthwestAir - I have spent 87 minutes (and counting) on hold w/ you today. After first 48 minutes, I gave up. Trying again &amp; on 43rd min.
@AmericanAir  hung up on now many times trying to cal 8004337300 crazy
@JetBlue ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels?
@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport
Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
@USAirways 45 minutes and moved two feet in BZE. 👎 http://t.co/AwGjkjIIac
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ✈️😃👍
@USAirways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check?
@usairways the. Worst. Ever. #dca #customerservice
@SouthwestAir you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
@USAirways FINALLY leaving 4 home from NC. Will lodge respectful complaints!! Mechanical issue after cleared for runway? #5hourwait #nocrew
@JetBlue nothing but praise for you helping our lady make her flight to CHS tonight!  #impressed
@JetBlue Thanks for the quick reply! Just wanted to make sure it wasn't just my account :)
@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
@USAirways wow this airline is a joke, absolutely horrendous customer service. you guys should be ashamed.
@USAirways Eyyyy! Cancelled Flightlations, Flight Booking Problemss, reFlight Booking Problemss, but y'all got me on the same flight out tonight (not tomorrow) &amp; the FC upgrade. Thx!
@SouthwestAir My flight was 952, leaving las vegas at 5:40pm, arriving at CHI-MID at 11:00 pm.
@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say "in progress" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th.
@AmericanAir 767 seconds from touchdown at Madrid airport in April 2013 #AvGeek http://t.co/1yWXRfn0Gr
@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest.
@SouthwestAir Black History Commercial is really sweet. Well done.
@SouthwestAir thanks, got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though.
@USAirways I cant make it to airport, roads are to bad in DFW and no one is answering the phones and the website is down?How do I reschedule
@usairways  my flight has been Cancelled Flightled. On hold for 2+ hrs to reschedule. Need help now.  Taking way too long http://t.co/NeHnsDCkTY
@united There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
@united thanks for the effort. I can get the earliest. Though I will make a complaint for a refund as I am losing one business day tomorrow
@SouthwestAir unfortunately no, it's my lack of status that's the big problem. My company policy forces me to buy the cheapest tickets
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable.
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround
@USAirways  please don't go to the check in process @AmericanAir uses at #MCO. It's an absolute disaster.
@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.
@JetBlue this feels nice - what we've got going on here. Let's just swap me out with the fool in 5a and we can make it all better.
@SouthwestAir understand weather is an issue but on time Cancelled Flighted reinstated Cancelled Flighted with hardly any updates and doing nothing for me= :(
@AmericanAir research buddy. Read my previous tweets and get some context.
@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst
@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
@AmericanAir yes I do I am traveling to Marsh Harbor
@SouthwestAir How to I rebook on-line when it keeps telling me that it's a reserv number for a past date (this morning)? Holding for 2hrs.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dxn58rxDkS”@jameskraw see.
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today?
@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
@AmericanAir is there a way to reserve my dog’s flight without speaking with a representative? Just was booted from your helpline!
@SouthwestAir has the WORST customer service of any airline I've ever flown.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?
@USAirways after a grt flight to PHX last week,  tonight was terrible. 2.5 hours taxing and you give us water and crackers to compensate.
@JetBlue probably not anymore.
@JetBlue, was far less painful than what was coming from Avis.  💙
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
@SouthwestAir Hey there, can you follow us so we can DM you a question :) 😁
@SouthwestAir LOVE your TV ad with the girl dancing. Makes me laugh every time, AND now I want to take a trip! :-)
@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for "rampers" #AA4285
@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping
@AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don't credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
@JetBlue Flight 1133 (N353JB) "Blue La La" departs @mco enroute to San Juan International Airport http://t.co/SWZm2fX3nu
@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I'm giving you a second chance. I'm just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home.
@SouthwestAir thank you. I was given this same reply 2 years ago. Can you direct me to an area I can learn more about the improvements?
@VirginAmerica I &lt;3 pretty graphics. so much better than minimal iconography. :D
@JetBlue I believe that the website said I could receive credit for upcoming flights since I Cancelled Flighted my last one. Is this true?
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
we all watched as the crew was escorted from the back to 1st class. Prebooked? Really? @united: @JenniferWalshPR Your dissatisfaction is und
@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
@USAirways WORST customer service ever!!!
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
@JetBlue Love you guys😍😍😍 http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
@AmericanAir Next Friday, I'll take AA3074 to LGA.Sat morning, US1951+US874.Do I have to take my bags at LGA or I get them to my final dest?
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
@JetBlue 1951 BOS to ORD
@SouthwestAir my wife has now been on hold for 90 minutes....I get weather is bad, but this is insane. #customerservice #customerloyalty
@united Thank you.
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
@Jetblue Delay = Perfect time to learn Swift programming with @TeamTreehouse
@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Mon http://t.co/Q37pOWn6uv @Cowboycerrone figures right?

@VirginAmerica So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I've heard nothing but great things about Virgin America. #29DaysToGo
@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
@AmericanAir today, after 6 yrs., no longer my preferred airline.
@AmericanAir called executive platinum desk and got a TWO HOUR call back time... 2.5 hrs Late Flightr still no call and still stuck in Chicago
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@SouthwestAir pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job!

@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to "check in" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher

@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication.
.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
Lol great answer.. “@AmericanAir: @JayFranceschi Our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.”
@SouthwestAir following. Thank you.
@united ^GJ funny, I did and the attendant recommended me tweeting you letting you know about my subpar customer service. #RunAround
@USAirways Can you provide me with info about checking strollers and car seats?  Costs?  Restrictions?  Need to bring 2 seats 1 stroller.

@AmericanAir can we get a status update on flight 1457? Are we going to make it home tonight...?
@USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response??????
@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!

@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
@JetBlue will we be able to watch the Oscars on our flight tomorrow?
@USAirways and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away!

@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!

.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines

@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.
@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a "tech stop"?
@SouthwestAir has the winner for #DestinationDragons been announced yet? If not when will they be??
@SouthwestAir LA always has traffic, but this is INSANE. I can't be the only one with this issue on flight 1625
@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
@AmericanAir No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
@united 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to @AmericanAir #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@united gives Belfast a #Hug with the new unmissable #BusHug format #impact #busads #thinkbus @BelfastAirport http://t.co/AvbdstJUJS

@JetBlue Hi! Does my upcoming flight 2168 from West Palm to HPN have Fly-Fi?
@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
So relieved I'm flying @JetBlue after listening to everyone at the neighboring gate bitch about Spirit. My airline's better than yours.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/gHJBp5Gg67” why
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
@AmericanAir and it's not a inconvenience it is a disaster. It's A $500 phone bill from you that you refuse to pay
@JetBlue 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it's 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail
@JetBlue Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX on or around the date of March 5?
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.

@USAirways - why can't the gate agent on flight #759 provide an update? Seriously, this is ridiculous how long people have been waiting
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@JetBlue friendly, engaging, personable, handled clarifying questions about baggage fees well, and took an interest in what I was doing.

@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@SouthwestAir do you ever reinstate Cancelled Flighted flights?
@USAirways I have LITERALLY been on hold since 3am est.PlatinumEventually hung up &amp; again back on hold. Understand weather, but ridiculous.
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
@USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
@JetBlue I LOVE JET BLUE!
@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights

@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@JetBlue thanks for the help
@SouthwestAir If there are any Imagine Dragons tickets left for tomorrow at @VelourLive here in Utah I would love to go I am available! :)
@USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg
@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
@USAirways husband tried to use dividends &amp; companion fair for emergency, transferred &amp; put on hold for over two hours gave up #disappointed
@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
@SouthwestAir iiiii need help with my flight schedule!!! haha
@AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
@USAirways Really hoping I don't get charged for this flight because they couldn't handle the influx of calls. Bummer.
@SouthwestAir yes but not with out an attitude and nasty comment
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.
@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
@USAirways Has the most useless &amp; Rude employees ever at Philadelphia airport never again will I fly with them ! 😤
@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!
@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
@AmericanAir Thanks guys got some sleep. Hang in there DFW with bad weather.
@SouthwestAir I never got my flight confirmation. I've been on hold for an hour and I can't get info online. What am I to do?
@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.
@USAirways Yes, it was Sunday.

@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga

@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice
@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail

@AmericanAir well I'm flying @JetBlue instead - for free! Their credits actually work.
@USAirways flight #3797 treatment of passengers has been atrocious - over 2 hours delay only to now deplane and given no direction
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
............. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/X7iLzqdwe2
@united Is it customary to upgrade a flight attendant in uniform vs passengers? One is in 1B on flt 1020 now to IAH
@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come
@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing.
@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
@AmericanAir The website won't let me view my reservation due to "changes made outside http://t.co/nwF2FkA8fY". I'm on hold now to get help.
@USAirways No I missed the funeral so I had to take a train back to Newark
@SouthwestAir Trying to get through by phone to confirm that funds from a Cancelled Flightled reservation can still be used in the future. Can u help?
@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO
@AmericanAir I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you
@JetBlue such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now.
@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.

@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
@AmericanAir could you guys follow me so I can dm yall please

@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it’s hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
@VirginAmerica you will match my #AmericanAirlines status? Cool!
@AmericanAir Thanks :-) Good to be back safely. See you again soon!
@AmericanAir ahhhh your silence is golden now.  This tops it all.  Anyone get fired?

@SouthwestAir I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united
@USAirways 2 days in a row, not buying it. I suggest you review your policy w respect to unaccompanied minors, should have had a seat on Sun
@JetBlue Thanks! See you soon!
@AmericanAir Hey, so... I think I left my wallet on you. Can I have it back, please?
@united please see dm!!
@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
@SouthwestAir love..luv the addition of the passbook option.
@JetBlue why are you always so amazing! #jetblue #trueblue http://t.co/iIMTJxcvLG
@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! 👍👍👍👍👍
@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Will do
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
@AmericanAir “Inconvenient” is such a convenient word.
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@united 3 hours to rebook but 8 hours l8r the same problem again. Arrive at gate stopped cause now infant is sitting in 4 yr old lap
@SouthwestAir how can I get tickets for Feb 20 Imagine Dragons show?
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy
nope. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/9SHhTvIOTI
@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5.

@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@AmericanAir I have a couple questions for you, if you’re available for PM?
@SouthwestAir LACMA on Fairfax.
@united same flight number different flight. I'm heading to MPLS
@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@AmericanAir ...is this how you want to treat your platinum (and two gold) flyers??
@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning.
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
Thank you for your help, Shannon! Great customer service, @SouthwestAir.
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@USAirways your IVR hung up on me because of high call volume? I need help. Call me
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating
@AmericanAir Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
@JetBlue When will you release November flights for Flight Booking Problems?
@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?

@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!
@SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight. I drove down and it wasnt. I just drove down for a second time and they were
@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!
@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4
@VirginAmerica I paid the premium to fly you across the country, you Cancelled Flight my flight and offer no check fee or upgrade love? Sad face :(
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!

Hey @united you've upgraded me on a 10 hour International flight. I forgive you :-) thank you!

@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?

@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?
@AmericanAir ok no worries. Thanks for the straight story. It's appreciated.
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@USAirways flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy?
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member

@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
@united wi-fi on 737-800 (aircraft 3511) didn't work entire ORD-DCA flight this morning
@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx
@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
@SouthwestAir 8FKQW is the conf #. Thanks for the reply
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
@USAirways FYI your customer service rep Carol is an absolute delight. So pleasant to with with and rebooked me in lightning speed! Thanks!
@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
@SouthwestAir love how "friendly" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes
@AmericanAir no kidding! Gonna take some beating on the apron... And there are some good lookin' planes out there!
@SouthwestAir was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had.
@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.
@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines.
@SouthwestAir I would be eternally grateful for tickets to the Vegas show ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) God bless

@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
@VirginAmerica Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...

@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@SouthwestAir I have been on hold for over 28 minutes  please help http://t.co/Fx9BIJlxAt
@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
@USAirways following you now
@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane
@SouthwestAir was in a line a mile long at sky harbor this morning. Your staff was courteous and expeditious.  Thank you. #onechildfourbags
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help.
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail

@united getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks.
@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
@USAirways thank you.
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@AmericanAir depends on the terminal, what' the best option? Arrive C, depart A. Breakfast burrito is what I'm craving.. Any update on 1119?
@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
@SouthwestAir sitting in Baltimore. Finish taxi and approved to takeoff. Oops, not enough fuel. #Fail #45minflight #been3hours

@united  thank you for a great flight in gfc :) Cheers http://t.co/nvLnGLnMGN
@JetBlue  hahah 😂👌👌👌 love flying jet blue tho!! http://t.co/7VeE44MACM
@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK
@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
@united WHERE IS MY RECEIPT! I upgraded return leg and 6 months Late Flightr still NO receipt! http://t.co/DAjWzhLVyu
@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
@united no worries, I think it’s under control. (the emails are keeping me informed)
@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@VirginAmerica check out new music http://t.co/maRcnOCWzn
@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!
@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.
@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
@VirginAmerica wish you flew out of Atlanta... Soon?
@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
@SouthwestAir I have a credit that expires a month before my flight, is there any possible way I can have that extended?
@SouthwestAir thanks! More concerned about the conflicting texts I was receiving my about my flight  Having to drive 10 hours now 😢
@united I'm glad 1K means something, lol!
@SouthwestAir when will you be accepting reservations past August 7?
@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 "goodwill credit" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it.
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@VirginAmerica  DREAM http://t.co/oA2dRfAoQ2 http://t.co/lWWdAc2kHx
@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
@AmericanAir tried that and can't get through.
@SouthwestAir iPhone App Adds Passbook Support #Airlines #Travel http://t.co/lJzDTHD9Bv
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
@JetBlue love it as always!
@USAirways how do I find an email address regarding reativation of dividend miles. Nothing on website
@USAirways @AmericanAir what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you
@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
@AmericanAir me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
@AmericanAir extra night we have to stay in San Juan now. How can I check on that?
@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
@JetBlue Ok great thanks! I had a great flight, FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in.
@AmericanAir its only 1500 characters, i will respond via formal letter. Trust me, I have plenty to say.
@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
@USAirways Ill never fly you again due to the emotional &amp; financial stress you have caused me because of one of your staff members errors.
@USAirways thx for taking my $600 for a 1way then Cancelled Flightling 1st flt delay 2nd flt and u top it off by losing my one piece of luggage #usuck
@JetBlue any idea what's going on at terminal five at JFK? Seems to be zero traffic movement
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that
@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
@JetBlue we've been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info?
@AmericanAir or at the very least an explanation on why no one told me my flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
@AmericanAir I would purchase it if I was there by choice but you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight and have me stuck at DFW for 7 hours!
@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
@united what would it cost
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@JetBlue well lucky I only fly JB..I guess I would be even more squished on any other airline 😞
@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold over 90 minutes. You can fly, but not answer the phone?
@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. 👎
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
@SouthwestAir @ PIT- Gate A1! Big shout out to the lady trying to track him down!
@JetBlue sorry for my misunderstanding of the term, but what does that exactly mean?
@JetBlue  Called JB 3 times!Everytime, Auto Vmsg:"your wait time should not be longer than 9 mins" waited longer than 18 mins and no answer!
.@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my “only” airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :(
@JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3)
@AmericanAir  2 hours to be answered on a call?
@USAirways are there such things as non-delayed flights or na? Get your shit together and get me out of here
@SouthwestAir Almost 2 hours on hold now. I just need to Cancelled Flight a flight and get a refund. Other airlines are operating!
@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@united sister &amp; BIL stuck in Detroit desperately need to be in Florida flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
@SouthwestAir Southwest is definitely my favorite airline to fly! :D
@JetBlue  Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises
@AmericanAir I can't!!!  No one can't get to "hold".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED
@USAirways, 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn't mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious.
@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
@JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 😢
@JetBlue its always a pleasure ☺️
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time
@VirginAmerica love it, taking @SouthwestAir on in their backyard! Consumers win when biz competes.
@SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
@SouthwestAir I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour
@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets!
@virginamerica Well, I didn't…but NOW I DO! :-D
Why lord why“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/nlzS1Ehnee”
@USAirways why the hell did you overbook a plane when you knew people actually had seat assignments. #inept #uncaring #piss poorplanning
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
@JetBlue CEO weighs profits, flyers - @ChronicleHerald (registration) http://t.co/9vKj9S7jrM
@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins
@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter.
@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
@USAirways Flight 496. How are u going to compensate me for sitting on the tarmac for 90+ mins and missing my PHX - BOS connection?
@AmericanAir tell me you can get me to ABI earlier than 8 pm tomorrow
@united Suck
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@JetBlue any news on flight 122 pbi-boston delay? Can we wait to arrive at airport based on reported 1 and 1/2 hour delay?
@JetBlue Vegas, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia so far! I'm a very frequent business traveler.
@USAirways it a change fee request from a month ago.  after one hour on phone with your team, I’m told 120 day backlog.  Awful.
@JetBlue waited for 15 min then got disconnect
@VirginAmerica I have lots of flights to book and your site it not working!!!! I've been on the phone waiting for over 10 minutes..........
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
@united flight #1 no luck on #standby
@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...
@VirginAmerica I think i left something on the plane yesterday. who do i call...ah!
@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of “We don’t care. We’re automated."
@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
@SouthwestAir can't speak with customer service for 2hours, still on hold! Do you guys work?#nogood
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game.
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--
@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@JetBlue thanks!
@SouthwestAir I couldn't fly you today &amp; it made the trip harder + had to pay for my checked bag. #DevotedyYours but for today. :(
@JetBlue  What are your rules on checked baggage and carry ons from SLC to SJO?
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@USAirways on delayed flight from Phil to stt and looks like we'll miss the car ferry to at john where our lodging is. Help with housing?
@southwestair TREMENDOUS job. Atlanta Airport saw SW celebrate Mardi Gras. Another reason I'm nuts for you guys! http://t.co/8WBzOrRn3C
@JetBlue thank you!!
@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@AmericanAir Trying  to Cancelled Flight fligt 2321 O'Hare to Dallas 12:17pm. High call volume no one answer. Online no confirmation. #thankU
@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
@JetBlue Stop trying to make #fleek happen! #PointsMe
@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?
@SouthwestAir thanks! I expected a wait... Just not that long. :)
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@USAirways 😂. Passed frustrated 4 hours ago after being asked to get off the first plane I sat on for an hour.
@united no my concerns were not addressed
@AmericanAir @united wrote back saying 'it's been a challenging week...that's for sure" - no shit.
@united yes please. Going to drive the 6 hours.
@United​ has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status.
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood all are great , but I have to go with #CarrieUnderwood 😍👌
@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir Yes! I did and the bags came straight to my hotel. Thank you ...you guys rock!
@JetBlue are we good?
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@JetBlue Thx for the quick response .... yep I tried- but it can't find the flight when I Input the Confirmation #
@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?

@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@SouthwestAir FREE Cable Out of this World Technology and a mans dream come true... FREE and PORTABLE???!!! http://t.co/Qw1til96YA
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@JetBlue thanks for listening. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate you!
@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
@JetBlue flight delayed 3x(!) and still not taking off on time, &amp; greeting me at my seat (yes it's gum &amp; garbage): http://t.co/n9hmcrJChb
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@AmericanAir the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and @CVGairport ground crew failed to do it on time, per pilot #maintenance
@USAirways Why is my "first available" flight for me now Tuesday but a flight today  that is "booked "#flt 755 available to buy online?
@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@JetBlue who do you think is gonna win Mayweather or Pacquiao?
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us...
@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?
@united do u serve peanuts/nuts on yr flights yr policies r confusing contradictory advice Pls help #Anaphylaxis,will u ask those 2 refrain?

@VirginAmerica Have a great week 🌞✈
@SouthwestAir coming up on 10 hrs and all at the gate, not leaving and without my baggage. SWA you are my nightmare!
@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
@AmericanAir I already landed! But, if you still care it was 1891. Thanks for the help though!, do you k ow what caused the failure?
@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways Looking for some help to recover an item I left on an airplane this evening
@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
@USAirways how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help
@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@AmericanAir Always enjoy my time. Now on the plane to DFW!
@united What delivery service do you use? I'd like to call them myself.
@SouthwestAir : Hello..are flights taking off from @DallasLoveField airport this noon. Am supposed to travel on flight 376 to San antonio
@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
@SouthwestAir heard you are saving 30k a year on fuel not carrying around those skymall's #ripskymall
@USAirways gold desk quoting me $900 to rebook due to weather. Can buy first seat on same flight for $440. Why? On hold for 45+ mins now
@AmericanAir anything you can do?
@SouthwestAir My husband a first time flyer with you has had the worst experience on board a aircraft just a few minutes ago.
@JetBlue what's the link for #FlyFi
@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the #DestinationDragons @ImagineDragons show tomorrow in Utah at @VelourLive! I've been trying so hard.
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@SouthwestAir got it.  Next time I will know about paying extra to make the A Line.
@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is, I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@SouthwestAir 3 flights Cancelled Flightled today. Now we have been on hold for over an hour!
@virginamerica awesome deals DAL-AUS for only $39 each way! https://t.co/xCVQXYkg49
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@USAirways Is your refund system down?
@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO.
@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue
@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again.
@USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying "we don't do that"
@USAirways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
@USAirways so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding!
@united now arrives LAX @ 8:03 am
@AmericanAir flight BA1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not Cancelled Flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather?
@JetBlue CEO battles to please Wall St and flyers - from @NZherald http://t.co/Q4Amiw7FSw

@JetBlue thank you
@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
@AmericanAir hi do you have a phone number to ring from uk regarding claim for our Late Flight flight departure claim amount agreed just had no
@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
@SouthwestAir sent
@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@AmericanAir that's not what I asked :)) I'm looking to change a Flight Booking Problems for 03.03. Can you help
@USAirways Thank you. But I don’t understand. What will you do with my feedback?
@JetBlue no news here at the gate. What are my options?
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
.@USAirways thanks!
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@AmericanAir Hi guys, can you tell me what the emergency is for #AA65 diverting to #Heathrow from Zurich-New York? Thanks, John.
@SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@USAirways what is contact info to upgrade using advantage miles?
@SouthwestAir do you have any tickets to the Atlanta show? I would love to go with my sister ♥️🙏
@JetBlue oh definitely. I kind of only fly JetBlue.
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails
@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED
@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
@SouthwestAir trying to get through to cust relations. Is there another # to use?
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V” this happened
@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...
@SouthwestAir question all.  When will I receive my yearly bonus point accumulation? I think it's around now but not sure.  Thanks! :)
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@SouthwestAir wanting a ⭐️ for the ✈️ finding the gate. No apology or exp. All good, I'm sure connecting flight leaving SAC will be chill!
@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
@united you're good. Thank you!
@jetblue what good with the inflight WiFi?
@united since UA 1226 ORD-EWR is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in First?
.@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're "watching" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
.@SouthwestAir I will if you can see about moving up my Brother in laws graduation to the 6th.  Thanks.
@JetBlue Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
@AmericanAir American Airlines.
@JetBlue I want to give a warm thanks to your crew at Logan airport for still getting me to the DC area after Cancelled Flightlations this morning!
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FVYzjLDTON” 🚶🚶🚶🚶
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
@AmericanAir Lady at B1 ABQ for 5347 on 2/23 was of a great service to all among several Cancelled Flightlations
@JetBlue Thanks. Still booked our trip 3/13-17 LB to SLC to see grand kids.  Just very frustrating. Tried app, web, etc. Still love u guys!
@JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
@USAirways Wife and I flew to Italy recently. Bought tickets via Finnair, flights operated by USAir. Didn't get dividend miles credited.
@JetBlue Ok and in Dominican Republic what numbers?
@SouthwestAir been on hold for over an hour to speak to a customer service rep. What the heck?? #Southwest #customerservice
@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look "normal" ????
@JetBlue BOS to DCA 1098 at 7:16 pm.
@SouthwestAir I never got a Cancelled Flightlation text from this morning either #bushleague or a number to call #weakservice
@SouthwestAir Thank you.  Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter?
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your help Adam and to the awesome gate agents at B12 in LAS for getting us home!
@SouthwestAir Stuck on 4251 with the heat blasting to try and thaw the water lines.... Kinda disappointed for my first flight as a RR member
@SouthwestAir Do y'all know when the new routes from HOU to Aruba &amp; Puerto Vallarta will be available?
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
@AmericanAir you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
@JetBlue App still saying I can't DM you...
@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@AmericanAir Thank you so much.
Hey @JetBlue, that's a sexy tattoo you got there on your left engine. #Jetbae http://t.co/Ox4w6KtsGI
@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Orlando early #happiness
@USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
@USAirways flight 4524 delayed for 2 hours for a deadhead crew.  Lets make 150 paying customers wait ...that is great service #USAirways
@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
@VirginAmerica I applied for a position in @flyLAXairport ,and I was wondering if you guys received my application.
@united still waiting
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@JetBlue you don't remember our date Monday night back to NYC? #heartbroken
@SouthwestAir are 5 people there?
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
@SouthwestAir any idea on flights to Nashville tomorrow being clear or Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick "Goodbye" Very Sad!
@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
@JetBlue two rows
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
@JetBlue Oh I will. #Disney bound. #workhard #playsoon
@JetBlue yes, but it hurt my feelings to walk by MINT. A fella can dream. #happy4them
@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
@JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) loses -0.06% on news that @JetBlue Airways ... - WallStreet Scope http://t.co/oFW4A8b5WS
@JetBlue sale please soon?? I need a tan
@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
@AmericanAir Hey, what's happening with #AA65 Zurich - JFK? Appears to have squawked 7700 and landed at London Heathrow
@SouthwestAir Gate attendant at McCarran C16 (Vegas to Dallas) went above and beyond. After a long day of frustration it was welcome.
@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir ok thank you!
@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay
@AmericanAir I tried that &amp; they have been disrespectful not professional &amp; my 2nd flight been Cancelled Flighted I have to get home for a surgeryHELP
@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
@VirginAmerica #thankyou the DAL-AUS route makes my day!!!!
@AmericanAir please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
@JetBlue We had some major plane-wide DirectTV issues yesterday. System kept being reset by crew member.
@JetBlue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk
@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
@AmericanAir thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice
@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated
@SouthwestAir @DeltaPoints hey at least you guys are honest with your customers unlike @Delta
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@JetBlue I would go anywhere JetBlue goes.
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue
@JetBlue Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously?
@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight
@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline
@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.
@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: "why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"
@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
@VirginAmerica we have a hot female pilot! Sweet! DCA to SFO! :-)
@JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@SouthwestAir eyes next steps for improving #inflight #Wifi - Runway Girl http://t.co/h46HT1Oz40
@USAirways How can I change without penalty and not have to call customer service
@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com
@JetBlue Are all of your flights out of Charleston tomorrow on-time or is there a possibility for delays/Cancelled Flightlations?
@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall
@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
@AmericanAir Yay, thanks! Appreciate the help, I know it's NUTS right now with the cold and ice!
@SouthwestAir I'll do that. Can't DM until you follow me. Thanks!
@USAirways where is your email address? Its not on this page: http://t.co/5cwH1yfOow
@AmericanAir so how do we get me a person?
@SouthwestAir Thank you so much for stepping up your game and making my day after night of elevator music. Much appreciated.
@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing.
@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
@JetBlue I was so excited when I saw that you fly there! #ionlyflyblue
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
@JetBlue when can we start Flight Booking Problems flights for November?
@SouthwestAir change your hold music, going on hour 3 and i'm about to loose it
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control—the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn.
@SouthwestAir Do you know the reason flight #336 from Dallas to Midland was diverted to Lubbock? Was suppose to be direct to Midland.
@AmericanAir not helpful
@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?
@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@SouthwestAir bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason, thanks!
@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane,looks stunning!
@SouthwestAir FS4VE7 when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said "well i was Late Flight"
@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!
@VirginAmerica can you please have flights in  SJC ? I have no choice but to fly Southwest to Vegas 😩😭
@SouthwestAir Yay! And are dependents with ID (wife children) eligible to use this discount too? How do you use it over the phone/inperson?
@SouthwestAir Been on hold for over an hour - any chance someone can help me on here?
@SouthwestAir - Great flight from Phoenix to Dallas tonight!Great service and ON TIME! Makes @timieyancey very happy! http://t.co/TkVCMhbPim
@USAirways on the phone over an hour waiting for customer service  got wrong fight information cost us 6 hours from trip. Frustrating!!!
@SouthwestAir a nice trip back home after a looong vaca 😊🌴 http://t.co/9TRvfnCedL
.@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home.
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the Atlanta show ♥️
@SouthwestAir haha...yeah i did, just making a joke
@SouthwestAir @karajusto OK we will! Thank you!!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir any help regarding flights out of KPHL would be much appreciated
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/we7Pf5Ll1Y” lol!!!!!
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
@AmericanAir can you please connect these two reservations together and also add a child in a lap. KEVOLT and SOZLDJ march 1. Thanks
@AmericanAir the whole plane is the same. How old is this plane?  The seats leather is coming apart ay the seams.
@united First complaint filed on Feb 11th, over 10 days now and still no response....disappointed but not surprised....
Thank you “@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH”
@SouthwestAir Gracias... appreciate that!
@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@JetBlue and The from @WSJ Team to Offer In-#Flight Access to Journal ... - Digital Journal http://t.co/ucF0B0bQ8r
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
@SouthwestAir  getting the run around today with customer service &amp; disconnected customer relations # given twice. Help!!!
@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable.
@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
@SouthwestAir crew on flight 206 is awesome! Tell them I sent this tweet and maybe they will give me free wifi... #canthurtasking
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?
@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@SouthwestAir just had a great flight #4223 with Damion! He was the best #damionflight4223
@USAirways and @AmericanAir aren't as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. Maybe @Delta or @united can get me home?
@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
@SouthwestAir Sorry! Thought I did. It's done now.
@USAirways flight 2120. Please get us a flight plan already. How is this an issue in 21st century?
@united I will admit, you've been rather good to me over the years.You've still got me hooked.(for now!)Peace.
@AmericanAir Sorry, what equipment? Have the passengers been allowed to return to the plane?
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@SouthwestAir Can't DM you because you don't follow me.
@AmericanAir can you tell me why flight 1542 from dfw to phl was Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow?
@JetBlue here you go... Your napkins pretty much say it all! http://t.co/OxY1Jnpjm3
@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
@JetBlue good luck. Thanks.
@AmericanAir Plane Veers Off Runway at Icy Dallas Airport http://t.co/DW6VDvqXBB
@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
@SouthwestAir I ❤️ you! The only airline that understands us military families and our unpredictable changes. Pound it 👊
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@JetBlue 795 to Austin
@JetBlue Yes, I filed yesterday around noon. I have a claim number but they haven't contacted me yet.
@AmericanAir you have my money, you change my flight, and don't answer your phones! Any other suggestions so I can make my commitment??
@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.
@SouthwestAir On hold for two hours and it timed-out on me. Great system you got there.
We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.
@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
@SouthwestAir AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
@USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
@SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice
@united got it right with the safety demonstration! Corporate but funny, reserved but NOT CORNY  as a… http://t.co/lwOtKIEKGU
@AmericanAir I just DMed you
@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@USAirways "We can't help you. We don't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it's against policy."
@united Joni did a great job on flight 5653 to LAX. Thanks for a great flight.
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@USAirways Past tense re help. No more. It’s been even more miserable than usual at CLT.
@JetBlue Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood
@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your "team" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting.
@USAirways needs to hire more people http://t.co/3LPVFhKy2F
@VirginAmerica i need to change my flight thats scheduled in 9 hours and 120 min wait time on phone. Im calling intern. Help!!
@JetBlue Using JetBlue air miles?
@SouthwestAir think flight 1945 from BNA to LAX will get off the ground tomorrow??? #please #snowbama
@AmericanAir SO BAD service in Miami, AirPort..
@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because "severe weather" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each.
@SouthwestAir Thank you - hung up after 1hr 7min on hold. Would you like me to DM you contact info?
@JetBlue hello! my husband bought us a trip last night &amp; just noticed my last name is misspelled! What can I do? Thanks!
@united Airlines is changing #mileageplus program March 1 http://t.co/4ojE523PTw
@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
@USAirways @CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave...
@AmericanAir F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!! thanks again for coming thru with great customer service!
@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
@JetBlue Sure! Email screenshot below. Link: https://t.co/soiQrN19aj http://t.co/IbVvTzLS4E
@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time
@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.
@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
@AmericanAir two delayed flights today that weren't weather reLate Flightd. Keep up the good work!
.@SouthwestAir Well, we all need something to aim for.
@SouthwestAir yall still fly in the cold right?
@united trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbernaturals! $$ http://t.co/1L9sCWPhph
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??
@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I always tell everyone to fly Southwest! Congratulations!!!
@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
@VirginAmerica you know it. Need it on my spotify stat #guiltypleasures
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@united nice and early back home! http://t.co/geG4nghmIE
@united 6344,6373, Sfo-Dfw also 1576 SFO-ORD
@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
@SouthwestAir another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!!
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
@JetBlue I hope so. The plane does appear to be leaving a nearby terminal for our gate.
@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
@united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids.
@AmericanAir a guy try right...
@USAirways still waiting on your reps to show. Now 40 mins into waiting in below freezing weather waiting for a cab.
@USAirways @AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ?
@united you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours.
@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting.
@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
@AmericanAir this might look good but the pita is inedible. Last year delicious shrimp cocktail. This year garbage http://t.co/Sotl8XQsrp
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!
@VirginAmerica Atlantic ploughs a lone furrow in the #MiddleEast http://t.co/FVUdmh27pF @TheNationalUAE
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
@AmericanAir most horrendous service ever !! On off two planes. Been in Phil for 10 hrs. Now captain can't get flight info to print? #wtf
@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
@united @bwood we'd prefer everyone hear our complaints amount your airline
@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
@SouthwestAir is making dreams come true with their #DestinationDragons scavenger hunt! You can win a chance to see Imagine Dragons! Go!
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
@JetBlue No, it's weird!! I picked other cities just to test, those worked...not the one I want. Works on phone though, so I'll use that.
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@USAirways flight 838 now leaving after 6 hour mechanical delay. Need lodging voucher and meals tonight in st Thomas who do I see?
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat....
@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
@USAirways thanks for the reply, hoping everything is cleared up in Charlotte by Monday
@SouthwestAir good to know. Perhaps it was execution then.
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir do you have special fares for students to visit prospective schools?  It's expensive to visit graduate programs.
@JetBlue also. My party { me and my sister and mom} are on three separate reservations. Will TSA lets us go through together or alone.
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@USAirways thanks 4 making it impossibly expensive 2 change 2 a flight leaving less than 24 hrs earlier than my reservation #1lesscustomer
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.
@VirginAmerica Can you give me Silver Status for 12 months?
@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious "entertainment" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse
@USAirways is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone?
@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons when are we gonna know I have a math test tomoro and I can't concentrate😭😭 #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir is there any way to manually add gift cards to an ex-EU ticket( AA metal on long haul,BA for intra-EU)?
@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
@SouthwestAir how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
@AmericanAir ... Do I have to even say anything?  Over 6 hours on hold... No one has ever sucked as much as you. http://t.co/NcrMqIBIWo
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights my flight, doesn't send an email, text or call. Then puts me on way earlier flight I might miss now. Thanks AA!
@SouthwestAir @geekstiel Do you know when the last chance is?
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@AmericanAir @emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
@SouthwestAir - total win!! Happy 7th bday on intercom, chocoLate Flight kisses, and a chance to hand out snacks.Thank you. http://t.co/NKloZcNtto
@united good job at CLE .. TPA on schedule ... 4 to 5 inches of snow ! http://t.co/9tbsJquw41
@USAirways HA!  You're fun.
@JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a "Customer Experience" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?
@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@JetBlue so yesterday a flight I wanted to Chicago was on sale within my points range and today it isn't. Any way you guys can still honor
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@AmericanAir &amp; if that wasn't enough, your staff have been so rude &amp; ignored passengers,don't think that should be accepted whatever reason
.@USAirways trying to get a partner PNR, and have spent more than 1 hour on hold.  I know its snowing somewhere, but this is awful
@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
@USAirways : When You've Got to Get There, We've Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent
@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online.
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!
@USAirways Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a msg that says "call volume is high." #vrm
@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!😢 still no bag!
@AmericanAir we have 8 ppl so we need 2 know how many seats are on the next flight. Plz put us on standby for 4 people on the next flight?
@united Death in the family cannot make flight tomorrow. Phone rep quoted $440 per person fee, which is almost the cost of ticket. Help?
@united Yes. Luckily I was there.
@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!
@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should
@VirginAmerica seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.it's really the only bad thing about flying VA
@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir ok the app doesn't seem to be working. just use the mobile site... http://t.co/4kLfywwMq1
@JetBlue nope. Currently sitting at my gate.
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@SouthwestAir I owe you an apology. My tweet was out of frustration, not constructive criticism. I'm a SW fan &amp; LOVE your service!
@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
@JetBlue THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :)
@JetBlue I'm so ready to see N598JB n N775JB on my Island but on a weekend to capture it
@JetBlue thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue http://t.co/5Db9eSBNzG
@JetBlue Now ur asking for the heavy guns! You know #IWouldDoAnythingForLove https://t.co/Yx1DQJn8nL #BrandMance #LoveSongFriday
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
@USAirways @AmericanAir USAIR #703 has returned to PHL due to issues with the fire detectors. What happens next?
.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
@united thanks for the upgrade today great way to start my week! Cc: @CiscoJimFrench @cobedien
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight won't refund me and told me 2 call customer service n been holding for 30 minutes still waitin #BadService
@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@SouthwestAir why can't i reschedule my flight online?
@united @perfectomobile I have to admit that not only the app is good but have lots of useful func (such the "live" seat map). Congrats
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@SouthwestAir Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?
@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip.
@AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can't get anyone from AA.  Can you help?
@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
@SouthwestAir If a travel advisory is posted for DEN, can I then make changes to my ticket? Anything I need to know before I call?
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
@JetBlue? | RT @WMCActionNews5: New airline expected to make its way to MEM http://t.co/Gbd5R1OlSI
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
@JetBlue btw, her name was Samantha and she won over everyone on the flight
@AmericanAir I need some help. My record locator is bringing up TWO different flights in your system. One op by AA &amp; one from US Airways.
@AmericanAir seriously, you treat your passengers like shit.
@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
@united look at this beauty 😉 dc-10 united airlines 😉 Hope you like this beauty 😉 http://t.co/NS1aCFqCdQ
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
😕 RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/4KH92mKoTZ
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on
@JetBlue thank you!
@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@USAirways  Interesting you forward compliments but never complaints!  World's worst airline #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service when trying to reach them by phone.
@JetBlue Great thanks
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
@USAirways I checked in "Standby for 1st Class" only to find I am "not on the list". This merger is a pain.
@JetBlue service for baggage at JFK is incomprehensible. No employee knows where our luggage is frM flight 424 LAX to NYC ITS AN HR WAIT NOW
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
@AmericanAir that's quite an impressive list of fees!
@VirginAmerica way to take advantage of #MayweatherPacquiao :)
@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service
@SouthwestAir hot stewardess flipped me off
@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
@JetBlue thx, social media person!
@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@AmericanAir but seriously if my cats dead I'm going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul
@JetBlue 117 days maybe.
@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@AmericanAir...still waiting for a call back....attempt #9 and hour #13...can't put a hold on an online tix, we are within seven day window.
@JetBlue Re: Flight 8088 SXM&gt;JFK what time does bus leave hotel on Feb 22?  Mass confusion here.
@SouthwestAir please acknowledge Attendant Jeff Wernicke. Beat in class and service on SW
@SouthwestAir flight just Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me rebook?
@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@USAirways Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to "maintenance". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting.
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
@USAirways 3 delays 2 Cancelled Flightlations a double layover and 72 hours Late Flightr....could I at least get extra dividend miles?
@SouthwestAir = easy and pleasant. @united = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@USAirways flight 2031, worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Regretting opening their air miles card #hotterandlongerthanhell
@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight.
@united even though technically after I land I will be silver?
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@USAirways can't get back lost time
@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
@SouthwestAir flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir?
@united thanks
@USAirways  can you help me out?
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat.
@SouthwestAir Make the world a better place: Visit an elderly relative.
@SouthwestAir I made it! Heading to Denver, and your employees really are as pleasant as I just told someone your application asks.  Thanks!
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@AmericanAir  help. Flight to Dallas was Cancelled Flightled this morning from cle. on hold for  3 hours. Need to be booked on next flight out.
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
@AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
@JetBlue I have many allergies and want to know if I can bring an 8oz. bottle of Benadryl on the flight along with my 2 epipens?
@united give her the recognition she deserves!
@AmericanAir, I've been booked on the wrong flight! And now PE desk has a wait of more than 2 hours?!
@USAirways that's where we are now. Thank you.
@USAirways Literally all that says is "Case open"  What good is that to me?
@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
@JetBlue the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
@USAirways 2 hours on hold. Still no answer. Horrible.
@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@united just did! Thank you!
@united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a.
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@USAirways new slogan should be "if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"
@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@SouthwestAir you know what'd be beyond awesome? A pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in ATL. A girl can dream #DestinationDragons
@united Okay, thank you for your help :)
@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies
@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.
@SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
No JetBlue… Just… no “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/mB3IPGs8zQ”
@VirginAmerica mood lighting on point🙌 Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet💤
@JetBlue Yesterday on my way from EWR to FLL just after take-off. :)#wheelsup #JetBlueSoFly http://t.co/9xkiy0Kq2j
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
@AmericanAir how we looking? We going to be able to get out on time? #flight353
@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
@JetBlue I love you
@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@SouthwestAir  when you take my money and do not provide a service makes for a profitable venture for your company. #IsItTheGaryKellyWay?
@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable.
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL
@AmericanAir understand waiting 2+ hours for callback on the exec plat line but when call dropped the agent could at least try again
@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!
@SouthwestAir great cabin and flight crew this morning on #578. A great smile and happy staff are signs of a happy company. Thanks.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/H11jglw74L”ayyy 😎
@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human
STAHP!! 😂😂😭😭😭😭 RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BM2unRaOnI
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is "On Request" now. Thanks.
@united and waiting
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
@JetBlue Well, I try! See you soon!! @JayVig
@JetBlue thanks so much!! ❤️✨ very relaxing flight!
@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
@AmericanAir Absolutely!
@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
@SouthwestAir your app isnt working and i take off in like two hours help
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5KshTUe6Q0” 😂
@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we’ve relatives nearby.
@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board
@AmericanAir thanks for following up- it finally worked!! Fingers crossed the new flight works.
@SouthwestAir Today is going to be the day, I can feel it!  Thank y'all for your support throughout! We're coming home Nashville! #Octavia
@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it 😃
@united that's fine. I'll take them.
@USAirways and I would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a
@AmericanAir flight 1041 is the first flight.
@SouthwestAir I WANNAA GO TO THE VEGAS SHOW SO BAD ID DOO ANYTHING #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue Oh that totally looks on par with @AmericanAir's Admirals Club; any way you can slide us a couple passes? ;)
@USAirways NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on.
You have to follow me back so that I can DM @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016

@JetBlue I’m going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
@AmericanAir Ps, I was right.
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@SouthwestAir do you have any info about when #DestinationDragons winners will be announced? me &amp; my best friend are hoping to win. thanks!
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
@united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = 😔
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
@SouthwestAir My GF lost the promise ring I gave her on flight 2707 2/21/2015 SFO&gt;SNA. It's an infinity silver band ring. Please help!
@united There is no "reference number." Your agent told me to "just drive to the airport" because "I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."
@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
@USAirways you can send my luggage to my house👋
@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
@AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
@USAirways lol me too
@SouthwestAir Flight 3056. Only an hour long but one of the best flights I've ever had. Kudos to flight crew and airline in general.
@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@JetBlue I will when I land.
@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.
@VirginAmerica  - Is Flight 713 from Love Field to SFO definitely Cancelled Flightled for Monday, February 23?
@USAirways 2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this??
@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@united still no response??
smh RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/IRiXaIfJJX
@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?
@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?
@JetBlue you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue
@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams.
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@SouthwestAir How to find out if my parents luggage really went to FLL on a Cancelled Flighted SW flight?  Called 1800IFlySWA, long long waits...
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@USAirways I cant get anyone on the phone to help with award travel.Purchased extra miles and 10 minutes Late Flightr the miles needed was raised.
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! FOLLOW ME BACK, PLEASE 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
@AmericanAir I just sent a DM
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
@united your seats are god awful.
@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
@USAirways after last night in Charlotte NC I'm seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves.
@SouthwestAir thanks a lot for sending a "special deal" with @Budget. Getting screwed is the best when on vacation #sarcasm get new partners
@AmericanAir how did my prime, ticketed seat get switched on AA 343?! Not sure what's going on here...
@AmericanAir So break whatever you want, take no responsibility..Too bad for customer? #media #filmcrew @chicagotribune @WSJ #nytimes @CNN
@JetBlue huge fan of great brands and people doing great things… you guys rock happy to share the love!
@USAirways This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club.
@VirginAmerica this is too cool!  Never been on ur planes but now I will!!
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@USAirways 8am flight to mco canld &amp; resch 1:30.If we opt for 8 am depart tom will us air allow cng return day from sat to sun w/o penalty?
@united it's been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I'm counting on it! #TeamUSA
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage… heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@JetBlue flight 705. EWR to FLL
@JetBlue How is travel bank credit issued by your company fraud - I acquired credit from family friend Charles Kravitz - see his account
@USAirways told me I deserved to be delayed because I booked the last flight and then I hear "the only inconvience is missing your flight"
@VirginAmerica This is such a great deal! Already thinking about my 2nd trip to @Australia &amp; I haven't even gone on my 1st trip yet! ;p
@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time &amp; apologized for yesterday
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@JetBlue thank you! Headed from LBC to OAK !
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways I'm sorry as well. It's been 24 hrs without my bag and I can't get a straight answers. I'm on call #6 for today.
@JetBlue last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy
@JetBlue Beatriz and Susan. Gate 4 MCO.
@United what the...? I go into the "all airlines lounge" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted
@AmericanAir You don't have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That's why we're done here.
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU SO MUCH YOURE AMAZING IM GOING TO CRY OMG
@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
@usairways sadly they've tried that and airport agents…no flights so they're stranded at PHL. No chance of a hotel for them?
@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected
@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
@JetBlue my daughter's college game in Denver.  Only one set of parents will be there 😢😢😢
@JetBlue it's been a while since I've angry tweeted an airline. Apparently you read my mind before I could bitch. Thank you for the credit.
@SouthwestAir Do you perhaps have a pair to the Atlanta show? #prettyplease
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
@JetBlue loved the service from the staff at Newark today. Good service goes along way.I appreciate your preciation  Nj ✈️Tampa 🔵🔵🔵
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
@AmericanAir can I DM you info?
@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
@JetBlue I digg it!
@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@SouthwestAir k but who won destination dragons
@AmericanAir Thank you for the info! Changes need to be made over the phone, correct? Is there any way an AA agent can call me directly?
@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
@USAirways my brother @BRizzyberg27 missed his flight traveling home for a funeral and can't get through to the call center, can you help?
@united where's my damn bag??
@USAirways you got to be "F"ing kidding me Usairways, 2hours on hold listening to yall selling loans and Valentine Flowers...SMFH
@JetBlue Airways to continue 'various commercial relationships' with #Lufthansa ... - @CAPA_Aviation http://t.co/vGqOihtRkH
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos.
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@USAirways flight today Cancelled Flighted  in phl, dozens of other flights still going. On hold for 3hrs. I need to get to my job interview!!!
@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@SouthwestAir that's gotta be a new record: 4 hrs in the air, 11 hrs waiting and 0 bags delivered to destination.
@united I miss the Continental days.
@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on.
@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.
@SouthwestAir is my favorite airlines. I've never had issues with them. Plus there crew is entertaining.
@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
@united The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/N2fvElcYgz
@SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today?
@SouthwestAir stewardess really funny! Now I could get the gent next to me to use some headphones, this would be the perfect flight!
@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
@USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip.
@SouthwestAir so glad u guys do business w/ more class than UR competitors @SpiritAirlines 😏
@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)
@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
@SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey
@USAirways really nigga.. Ur a fuck boy
@JetBlue Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV.
@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!
@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
@AmericanAir appreciate it!!
@AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet...
@JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
Stop the madness "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q5a7jtkI5K”
@SouthwestAir flight 3970, bna-rdu had the most excellent crew today
@AmericanAir My pleasure, next AA flight - this Wednesday to Milan, Italy for @MIDOExhibition -- See you then! :)
@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight.
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
@SouthwestAir Jason (108639) at Gate #3 in SAN made my afternoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!
@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
@USAirways so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd
@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
@SouthwestAir will you please work out a contract with @triflight to offer service there..
@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights my flight, doesn't send an email, text or call. Now I'm stranded in Louisville.
@united I attempted to book a ticket 3 times and kept getting a 'error' message. I hope you didn't still charge me.
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology
@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
@SouthwestAir on hold for over an hour twice?  Terrible.
@united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up
@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
@AmericanAir Hi. I have KOA-LAX-PHL-ORD booked as a 1-way savr awrd. If I called to chnge it to KOA-LAX-PHX-ORD would I have to pay any fees
@united thank you for flying me out of the mess at IAD and out to San Diego. http://t.co/tlPBaupIk5
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@USairways Since I am a loyal USAir customer I am sure that they will make this up to me-right now I want to get home &amp; back to work.
@USAirways when AA gate supervisor 600117 was asked for his superiors name, response received was "the CEO of #AmericanAirlines" #merger
@united I need a breakdown of what the "international surcharge" on my flights cover. Please help
@SouthwestAir great day in the air. http://t.co/YNc2ZUt4zz
@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
@USAirways @nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@VirginAmerica Hey, first time flyer next week - excited! But I'm having a hard time getting my flights added to my Elevate account. Help?
@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!
@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@VirginAmerica thanks to your outstanding NYC-JFK crew who moved mountains to get me home to San Francisco tonight!
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@JetBlue #669 stewardesses can't work w/o a galley light! Back to NYC to change a light. #fromthefrontseat #jetblueBlues @anku @yaffasolin
@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a "wrong" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@SouthwestAir can you speed up your flight from AZ to Omaha? I need to see muh boy ✈️
@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
@SouthwestAir loved it!
@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.
@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
@AmericanAir well have all day and all the time in the world
@USAirways this very pregnant lady's hoping &amp;praying hubbys flight from BWI gets off the ground! I'd like him to get here before baby does!
@SouthwestAir Why won't you let me leave Newark!?
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@SouthwestAir Thx to customer service rep ALEX for his patient help in reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight and getting us where we have to be tmrw!
@SouthwestAir your customer service is terrible, you're terrible, thought you should know.
@JetBlue with 3 kids and 11 days 340 + doesn't work and it's months in advance
@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@VirginAmerica Can you find us a flt out of LAX that is sooner than midnight on Monday? That would be great customer service 😃
@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
@AmericanAir Define "sincerely". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media.
@SouthwestAir Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU
@SouthwestAir would be great if I atleast was next to my husband who is flying in the same reservation
@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?
@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
@USAirways we're glad to hear it. Out of curiosity, what causes such flight patterns?
@AmericanAir Thanks. Having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info.
@united Can you help me get a flight out tonight to Houston?Just don't want to be stuck here till Monday with all this bad weather moving in
@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM
@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
@SouthwestAir 40 minutes still haven't talked to one person #shocking phone is gonna died before I talk to anyone http://t.co/iWoiGRLHXb
@USAirways pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal!
@SouthwestAir used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
@AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort
@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
@united What does "Cabin Functionality" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?
@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
@SouthwestAir i hope i can take my selfie stick on the plane today! #goingtovegas
@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion.
@JetBlue you can't beat jetblue in space's matter http://t.co/NRpWmGyv3e
@united oh, the Wi-Fi router is on top of the fuselage! ;)
@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
@USAirways this has been my WORST flying experience with you guys, you need to do better
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?
They didnt just tweet this... Nah. RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1yLn1Gx4QX”
@AmericanAir long mait. Repair wait at gate - Capt Said "paperwork formality"- forced to check bag rudely-returning CC reader doesn't work
@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.
@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
@JetBlue You definitely will!
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@SouthwestAir  I have a flight 2/22 @930 am from Fort Lauderdale to bwi.. Can I Cancelled Flight that flight ? Flight 3458 trip I'd 314505529
@JetBlue great.
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@VirginAmerica Just DM'd. Same issue persisting.
@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense
@SouthwestAir traditionally used sledge hammer - low $ taking share from driving | now scalpel approach through data science  #ANAmarketers
@JetBlue thanks!
@USAirways i have been tryng to rsrv a flight over the phone over the past 4 days and keep getting an automated message to call back?!?!?!
@united thank you !
@AmericanAir You are having phone issues.  Please fix it!!!!
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
@AmericanAir thank you AA, this is how I always start my vacations http://t.co/dzKc3auZU9
@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
@SouthwestAir Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
@SouthwestAir Are we sure flights will not be Cancelled Flighted after 1200 I am trying to make plans in STL
@USAirways The automated message isn't helpful and it's impossible to speak with a human right now. Desperately need our luggage :(
@SouthwestAir I continue to be amazed by the amazing customer service.  Thank you SWA!
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir need to Cancelled Flight a few more can you please check DM
@SouthwestAir worst customer service, Terrible attitudes. I don't care how big a storm.  Your employees need an attitude adjustment
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of "weather" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir Please update your website
@usairways 2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
@AmericanAir thanks
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp
@SouthwestAir no, thanks. I think we have it straight!
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
@USAirways How do I get through?
@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@SouthwestAir CEO Gary Kelly, "You all are absolutely my heroes!" #SouthwestRally #BWI #bestemployees #swaculture http://t.co/JTxyHQHfJJ
.@SouthwestAir Yes, total of 4 hours on hold. With all the Cancelled Flightlations, one would think there would be more staff. Decided to cx and drive
@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
@JetBlue figured but delay is listed at almost 2 hrs. Thanks for being great! Cheers
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@SouthwestAir + @twitter  = outstanding customer service!  Thank you!
@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback

@USAirways Chairman Preferred with 518,758 lifetime miles. What is my US Air reward, no #firstclass upgrades on @AmericanAir as usual.
@USAirways I have nothing but issues when I fly w/u what's up w/that?! #travel #vacation #awful
@SouthwestAir hey... Why don't you add the intl number to your error when checking in. Going on 6 hrs looking for a way to checkin. #cancun
@united thx for update
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
@USAirways can you please train your mechanics? Teach them to bring the tools to fix the plane with them and not leave them in the hanger.
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles.
@JetBlue yesterday's deal?
@SouthwestAir I would love a +1 #RedCarpet  treatment
@SouthwestAir Late Flightly you've always been Late Flight! Please get back to the old #SWA!!
@USAirways been on hold 2+ hours trying to reschedule Cancelled Flightled DCA-BOS flight. Can anyone help?

@united I submitted a status match last week and have not heard back. Im a delta customer looking to switch to United. Please assist.
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@JetBlue Thanks!
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
@JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo
@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
@USAirways when your routing system goes down which grounds all your long haul flights you should think about a #failover plan
@JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay
@SouthwestAir Thank you thank you thank you
@united it won't help...been there done that.
@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt?Best, Fabrice
@USAirways It's the rude and arrogant gate personnel. Uncalled for. Unprofessional. #theworst
@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
@USAirways we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage?
@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@united DM sent.
@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right.
@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@AmericanAir I fly weekly with you and haven't seen one
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open-- My request to merge the accounts is denied
@USAirways yes - tells me the only way to mod plans is to call the 4322 number.
@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@JetBlue I just booked a flight with you guys. I'm reconsidering that decision now after reading this tweet.
@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
Bruh “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W9BQiw0aou”
@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free "This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry" tequila shots?
@SouthwestAir If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.
@JetBlue thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/

@VirginAmerica Is there anything going on with the website? I've been getting a lot of errors past 30 minutes.
@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening
@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
@JetBlue Hi. How do I claim points on a 1800-flowers order after I purchased? I totally forgot to put in the promo code.
@AmericanAir Karen Riedel is a rock star employee and a miracle worker.  I really appreciated her help this morning!
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.
@AmericanAir please improve business extra flight reservation process. can't book online?  what century are we in? 25 min+ on hold
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
@VirginAmerica Keep up the great work :)

@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.
@SouthwestAir lost my sunglasses &amp; case on a flight 3933 last night - is there a lost &amp; found?
@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
@JetBlue Challenge accepted. First 5 crew members to send pics in the chairs get FREE tickets to visit us. #wager #IsItSummerYet
@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member.
@USAirways Can't wait for the trip. Thanks for getting me there!
STOP @JetBlue
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change frm AA 2401 to LAX at 6:50am MONDAY morning then AA 2586 from LAX to FAT to flight AA 1359?#helpAA
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... 😒
@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
@united no apology? Cool.
@united Yes ! :D (Y) From @therealaviation on Instagram :)
@SouthwestAir Can a pair of tickets waiting for me after my sports practice? I live here and definitely know where that is! @Imaginedragons
@USAirways this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me.
@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights
@AmericanAir record number is BPDFPP.
@united @annricord Great! Appreciate it😊
@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane "loses its software" I believe you decided to do an upgrade...
@SouthwestAir I love imagine dragons o flipping much, pls #DestinationDragons
@USAirways the plane i am on is having mechanical issues. Why cant i get off and get on a new flight? Now i have missed my connecting flight
@USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
@JetBlue okay thank you! I'll check with them again!
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
@AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology.
@SouthwestAir Hi Guys good morning how are you doing
@AmericanAir no worries you're swamped I know just dmd back THANK U
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable
@USAirways as far as being delayed goes… Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
@SouthwestAir Hey yea I got thru...everything is good now (well, in 7-10 days when the voucher goes through)  Appreciate it!
@USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
@AmericanAir it was 639
Why we can't have nice things. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/HP9RPPCvHx

@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home.

@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait "over 2 hours" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?
@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FRAqDPKyga” @hellobrittNEY_
@JetBlue when will you release flights for February 2016?
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@USAirways thanks for the seat that doesn't recline. I'm shocked I'm not being asked to serve everyone drinks on the plane.  #DoBetter
@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
@JetBlue thanks
@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
@United "Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flighted tonight and was told I won't receive a travel voucher for the inconvenience. Is that really your policy?
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
@USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX impressive lack of concern by 1hr+ Late Flight flight attndt wrecking havoc on customer travel #smugsmirk #norush
@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog
@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(
@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@JetBlue and stranded passengers aren't being helped to get another flight?
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?
@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@SouthwestAir thanks for the drink tickets hook up! Can't wait for my first international flight with you to NAS! #pumped
@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ
@JetBlue, I've experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr
@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!
@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say "oh well"
@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@united gave me a smile today, with a Zero Award... ;-) Computers have some sense of humour :-) http://t.co/JNqNbk7HuT
@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?
@USAirways how do you do that? You guys need to have much better communication. How? How can we do that?
@SouthwestAir So there were 134 early-bird check-ins, because I was told there were no flythroughs? Good flight, otherwise ~
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@VirginAmerica can’t access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff.
@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but...
@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part...
@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
@JetBlue can you share where it is coming from?
@SouthwestAir doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled I called they said they'd call back in 1:36. They did And hung up now saying I have to wait 2 hrs!!
@JetBlue I'll read this over a nice glass of wine right before I dig my heels into my next novel! Maybe travel is just what I need...
@jetblue I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab.
@SouthwestAir can you follow me so I can send the DM?
@AmericanAir need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can't travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB

@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
@USAirways how about an update with real information?still waiting on Tarmac in Philadelphia.
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@united thanks! Everything a-ok now.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/t2qBGAMfpc” this happened
@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
@SouthwestAir is there a way to DM you?
@united one lady helping the 12 of us with luggage
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
@USAirways I am following you now
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@SouthwestAir SW rocks, thanks for the reply and the follow. Rebooked earlier flight!
@USAirways if there are empty first class seats on my flight at check in, why wouldn't I be automatically upgraded?
@USAirways  my flight was #3729...but I left my phone on the plane or the shuttle :(
@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@SouthwestAir Password reset email is incredibly slow to arrive today. Checked spam folder, too. Web site says a few minutes, but 15? :|
@SouthwestAir thanks for your assistance..you guys ROCK!!💯
@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@JetBlue you are officially my favorite, thank you for the wonderful service at JFK
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congratulations!
@JetBlue Gotcha... but "lessening the delay" ... that part's not happening, right?
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!
@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA
@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@virginamerica Need to change reservation. Have Virgin credit card. Do I need to modify on phone to waive change fee? Or can I do online?
@SouthwestAir I will tell marry a lamp if you give me tickets to the Vegas show please I am desperate
@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
@SouthwestAir you have let me down! #oversold #earlybirdmeansnothing
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
@united has the best customer experience via twitter - huge fan!!!
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley 😃😃😃
@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
@SouthwestAir Roger wilco.
@USAirways what's going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!!
@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
@JetBlue since high likelihood of snow at time of flight tomorrow, any chance I can rebook for Sunday?
@SouthwestAir I'm teaching new #travelers how to research, #budget &amp; #save for a trip today! http://t.co/Qll48r57ep
@SouthwestAir I knew I was correct! http://t.co/9eueYxAwcv
@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@SouthwestAir lets chat about flights to and from BWI and the Carolina area... Can a girl get break? I've had to resort to USAir 😖 2 a day?!
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.

@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@SouthwestAir it took ages for one snapchat story to load. one. ONE. I will demolish you
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@united Thanks JT
@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
@SouthwestAir so was there a winner for #DestinationDragons ???
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
@USAirways the plane crew has been as professional and courteous as the gate agents were flustered.
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for the last 2 hours - no progress #pleasehelp #stranded #whenitsnowsitpours #tgcyaLate Flightr

@SouthwestAir weather bc of system outage. Hopefully everything goes smoothly now. Thank you for follow up
@united well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
@USAirways Done
@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
@united Hi again, any updates here?
@USAirways   US AIRWAYS DON'T CARE FOR CUSTOMERS. Worst experience today with US airways.. Myself, wife and toddler
@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
@AmericanAir this is all i gotta say to y'all &amp; your staff... for real http://t.co/rKPRxTGvfL
@SouthwestAir - stuck on the runway, again. Delayed on Wednesday. Not a good way to take care of your loyal customers.
@JetBlue how do I get a copy of my last flight showing original time and delay? I need it for work. Thanks!
First base already? I like your style @JetBlue
@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
@AmericanAir That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?
@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
@united no u don't
@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
@AmericanAir hey guys. DMed you a question about when 500-mile upgrades post after earning. Hope to use tomorrow
@SouthwestAir 4 flights Cancelled Flightled in one week?! Customer Service is 💩💩💩💩
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
@JetBlue just leave certain things to the kids.
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ❤❤
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves.
@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!
@united was in the air. Just DMd you
@AmericanAir thank you!
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
@JetBlue Dumps Amex - Nassau News Live http://t.co/DZg99JFIiK
@SouthwestAir oops, Sorry, Done,
@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@united Ha… you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
@USAirways @AmericanAir. delay and mechanical issues on both my weekend flights. Ridiculous. Will tweet as long as we are delayed
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
@united you are really trying me today.
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for 30 minutes &amp; no one knows how to win these tickets that you're still handing out? #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
@VirginAmerica are flights leaving Dallas for Seattle on time Feb 24?
@SouthwestAir Have had a companion pass for a few years and my wife and I use it all the time.  Thanks #southwest for making travel easy!
@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
@USAirways @AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update?

@AmericanAir btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding
@united There is only one club at LAX  - in terminal 7 across from gate 71
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried.
@USAirways @caterobbie if that link worked most of us could take care of ourselves  please contact your tech people to get that working
@JetBlue I clear that folder regularly and JetBlue is white listed so it never got to me.
@AmericanAir um no just hanging out what’s new w you?
@SouthwestAir yes please.my son lives in NJ.
@united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
@USAirways i did and i'm not stupid. i've done web development for 19 yrs. the issue (now confirmed by your support) is YOUR website.
:( RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ncguZDgDaQ
@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)
@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the "broken lightbulb"
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@united thats weak. See ya 👋Hey @VirginAmerica !!
@SouthwestAir still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!
@AmericanAir @karabuxthomps Yeah, I have a lot of questions, number one: how dare you
@united customer service 👎
@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp; I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
@SouthwestAir @poisonpill76 im in same boat.. 8am flight to Jacksonville... Get me out of here!!
@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
@JetBlue yes! Terra blue chips were my favorite. :)
@JetBlue @T5Sparrow Love it. They're cute
@AmericanAir thank you
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@SouthwestAir Great trip on 2672 yesterday - outstanding flight attendants
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@USAirways Ok Thanks
@USAirways Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks!
@united how do you go fr Silver Elite for two straight years to group 5 all the time?  I get no group 2 but maybe 3 or 4?  What's up?
@AmericanAir Can you check on he status of my EXP membership card? Need the physical card to access some international lounges soon.
@JetBlue imma need the hook up tho
@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
@JetBlue we have. Twice. They said they can't dim those lights. But they did on our first flight.
@SouthwestAir every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?
@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@AmericanAir I'm on flight 1027 tomorrow that got Cancelled Flightled. Need to find an alternative to get to Dallas. Please help.
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
5 hour delay = shortly?“@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS”
@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a "no show"
http://t.co/EIw2sYb8Fu roberts&amp;s=1 @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@USAirways @MrRenevendez I've been trying to contact them for 24 hours already! Yesterday I waited 7 hours today 5+! http://t.co/gn30p75KqB
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
@SouthwestAir @ClinicPolly Thank you-- I may have already responded but was 8UXZJ2
@JetBlue shows us their sense of humor with these tongue-in-cheek flight etiquette videos: http://t.co/GGuAA1JvDF
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp
@USAirways your service in Philly is unacceptable. Look into better service✌️ a 16 yr old shouldnt have a hard time http://t.co/WDAKTmr7Mj
@VirginAmerica has the most INCREDIBLE customer service I've ever experienced! So refreshing!
@AmericanAir Amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with.
.@VirginAmerica They were very understanding and helped me out.  Thx! #Comps
@AmericanAir thanks!
@united I lost a voucher that I was given in Miami aeroport on jan 26. I did not use it.
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@JetBlue Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle!
@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
delete your account @JetBlue
@AmericanAir hook me up with a free trip to Barbados and I will tell you the secret beaches to see
@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
@AmericanAir I'm sure they did. It's certainly chilly back East today! 😮

@VirginAmerica Beats EPS Views, Takes On #SouthwestAir VA LUV - Investor's Business Daily http://t.co/FLwmGDAHxu
@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some "white revive" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single.
@SouthwestAir now flight is book and I have to fly standby if they will allow me to check in before the flight takes off
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@JetBlue you all are the best #flyfi # ondemand #leatherseats #hipunis #legroom
@AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You're like a bad boyfriend!
@SouthwestAir check the head of the plane, there has been dynamite placed onto it
@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
@united flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together.
@USAirways here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted
@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
@SouthwestAir after a long wait of over an hour my mother's bag did not make it. We filed a report and are waiting. Thanks for your help
@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
@JetBlue appreciate what you've done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling.
@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting "Webpage not available" after submitting online form
@SouthwestAir Flight 4110 MCO to ISP delayed. Any details on why?
@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
@SouthwestAir thanks for the ride to Chicago. #kmdw #b738 http://t.co/6cpYPGFnD6
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great
@united Brian at SFO customer service deserves a raise, gave me extra meal voucher and a good joke to cheer me up after flight delay. #FTW
@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
@JetBlue ETA for flight 802 into Orlando this morning
@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment.
@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
@SouthwestAir everything OK? This is my 3rd call for the day and this time I've been on hold for 1.5 hrs. I'll hang up and try again.
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@SouthwestAir beyond ready
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@SouthwestAir I actually could use a slight tweak to my return - not leaving here now til Monday -any way I can skip calling for that?
@JetBlue My #FlyingItForward affects just one small family of four, but it would make a huge difference in their life.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine great news.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2UaICFJRmS” no way
@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff

@SouthwestAir Tell me the secrets to flying high #RedCarpet
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
@USAirways I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time.
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/D1eRGPdWsJ
@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm.
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@AmericanAir @dfwairport That's DFW!? OMG! Yeah cold, everywhere!
@AmericanAir thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money.
@AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven't received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come?
@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything.
@united You're welcome.
@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
@united Just sent! Thanks :)
@USAirways color me confused but why would i need to call and do this. Update your procedures and policies. You can see who is connecting
@USAirways Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you
Stop. Please. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/EUl6sDURbU
@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
@JetBlue expanding!  http://t.co/Kk6EixifP5  #Nantucket #Aviation
@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.
@united correct date is 2/11/15!
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
@USAirways I did. They told me it was a 40 min wait &amp; they'd call back. It's already been 45 min. Horrible
@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove
@SouthwestAir give this guy a raise....great start to flight from AZ to MKE..

@united Hi! what is the phone number for reservations in Venezuela? Thanks
@USAirways I have been trying to get through to a representative for 7 hours aboout my Cancelled Flightled flight. Have you simply given up?
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
@SouthwestAir Please lower my plane flight by like $100 bucks!! Thanks~ #FloridaVacation
@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte
@AmericanAir Jacquelyn at Charlotte just denied me compensation after #2251 was Cancelled Flighted due to plane malfunction well within your control
@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
@SouthwestAir I have a question re: your ATL companion pass offer. I know I need 3 revenue flight roundtrips. What's a revenue flight? thnx

@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
@SouthwestAir still haven't been able to get through, thanks for responding
@VirginAmerica not worried, it's been a great ride in a new plane with great crew. All airlines should be like this.
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
@AmericanAir is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.
@SouthwestAir aww thanks!! Other than that, love it!
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
@USAirways but need to confirm please help
@AmericanAir Thank you for the worst experience ever on an airline, from me to you, I hope your embarrassed as an airline. Pathetic
@AmericanAir the last was 2339 dfw to ord. Not weather reLate Flightd... Austin leg delayed as well

@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!

@united great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don't, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!!
@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300.

@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper "she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"
@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.

@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
@USAirways there is no extreme weather in Miami. Pick up the phone. Hire more people.
@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job.
@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
@SouthwestAir answered. My options are a refund or a resched for Monday (I'd miss work). So I'm paying hundreds for a @USAirways flight tmw.
@USAirways have scheduled flight Sat(2morrow) CHO-CLT CHO needs to be added to weather advisory.  Please evaluate asap.
@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out @united answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight.
@southwestair thanks for taking it up a notch!! leinenkugels #craftbeer #goodflight @ Norfolk… http://t.co/TgSLjjN6g0
@AmericanAir @barrettkarabis what a joke you can mailThe receipt !! Yet. We can't mailThemA payment and fly before hand right
@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night.
@united is #ELP Friendly. #flyerfriendly #united #emb145 #elpaso http://t.co/9mEOzBO4xl
@JetBlue window exits give it away.
@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
@AmericanAir fantastic thanks! Will try and tweet a photo of the view :)
@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.
@JetBlue @NinaDavuluri 😃cool
@AmericanAir ...2/2 doesn't help me.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@SouthwestAir Also, will Southwest have any other specials like the one they are running now?
@USAirways @AmericanAir working for me. Tight cx @Mia so they're delaying our flight. Twice. In 20 secs @jabevan221 http://t.co/G3Uy6w28QH
@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
@USAirways Never heard back, but this would help: Any chance I could bump up my flight time closer to 3pm today? I'm on flight 3960.
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
@SouthwestAir you guys are so amazing for sending people to meet Imagine Dragons #DestinationDragons 😋
@USAirways thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet 😊
@SouthwestAir no fare giving out clues.  In route now.
@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@VirginAmerica did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@JetBlue finally! Finally!
@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
@AmericanAir has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV.
@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@SouthwestAir On hold over 2 hrs and got cutoff !Cancelled Flightled my flight, now can't get to booked cruise in Florida! Terrible customer service!
@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv
@USAirways I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
@AmericanAir I used the "call back" feature with an operator regarding my flight, got a call 2 hours Late Flightr and got hung up on. #pleasehelp
@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
@SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow
.@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. "But there are rules" says @united
@USAirways I realize the weather but day after day our flights keep getting Cancelled Flighted. Please prioritize ur passengers and help them
@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. "Look, over there to the left!" Actual announcement.
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!
@united just dropped bags at Newark. Your desk guy was the rudest customer facing person I have met. Even my two children were shocked!
@USAirways I just got hanged up on trying to get to an agent. Can you help?
@USAirways on hold 2 hours 54 minutes. What's going on?
@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a "baggage error" #sarcasm
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
@USAirways truly been the worst experience this weekend. Delayed, rerouted 3x, now not boarding A 715 flight and says flight is "on time"
@SouthwestAir what number can we use to all from outside the US? Thx
@united 1632 was phenomenal frm gate (SEA) to gate (IAD)
@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united not for me.  I am on another Ua flight 2 gates down that was held 15 mins for cnx pax.
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
“@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML”:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
@united Wasn't frustrating! Well, not in any way reLate Flightd to y'all, anyway. Impressed that I made it.
@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I’ve been on flight 1776 from BOS —&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain
@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh
@SouthwestAir Any idea when the winter advisory will be posted for ATL for tomorrow (2/25)?? I'd rather get to PHL tonight.
@united San Diego to Chicago. Leaving at 6:15 am tomorrow
@SouthwestAir How do I get a companion pass??? Thanks,  Lin S
@USAirways @AmericanAir Flying from Orlando to Philly to Charlotte to Lynchburg. Saw advisory re Philly. Wld like to fly from Orl to Char
@united i DMed you the details
@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
@SouthwestAir though I work for another major airline,  I LOVE your Black history month commercial. I Thank you.
@USAirways Been on hold 2.5 hours now! System hung up on me twice after an hour holding. :(  Trying 2 correct online Flight Booking Problems error. #unhappy
@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
@USAirways On hold for &gt;70 mins on my 3rd attempt just to get a receipt showing change fees for an upcoming flight. Please help!
@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee
@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
@USAirways I have fam thats supposed to fly 2/22 that are currently in the hosp.3 trys to speak to a human, yr phone sys cuts off. pls hlp!
@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways
@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: "can I have some water?" "no we don't do that. please take your seat"
@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
@SouthwestAir My husband is responding to him and he insist to remove him from the seat. BTW signs are in both English and Spanish.
@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?
@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!
@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!
@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold.
@AmericanAir boarding in 2mins YAY!!!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir major issues getting out of Boston, but your crew has been exceptional. Let's see how things roll out in Philly.
@AmericanAir the Late Flightst usair4603. Earlier 4591

@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@united Thank You
@SouthwestAir husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can't confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts!
@USAirways final count 3 hours 24 minutes on hold to be told I need to log in to U.S. Airways website and there was nothing else to be done
“@JetBlue: @KyleComer_ JetBlue reLate Flightd this time? ;)” no... But why won't school be Cancelled Flighted? it's very cold out
@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
So appreciated! @united
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the "no charge" part.
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@SouthwestAir shout out to the flight #4386 crew for taking amazing care of us on our double down flight! #thankyou
@SouthwestAir Got it, thanks. Any insight into what will happen tomorrow?
I've been trying to set up my phone interview for days, and hoping the position won't be filled because the link doesn't work. @USAirways
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
@VirginAmerica Having an issue finding a missing item on a plane. Can you help me find which airport my plane headed to next?
@VirginAmerica they told to check with the airline regulation first so that is why I contacted you.
@AmericanAir help http://t.co/hYrAo7A4Uu
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@JetBlue Our non-profit ARC would love tickets as we rely on airlines for extractions in saving abducted children and returning them Home!
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@SouthwestAir Thank you ^AH. Still wish someone picked up the phone - 3hrs- dead phone. Taking your tweet as a refund confirmation.
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Daily Journal http://t.co/bTb4awQtln
@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@USAirways @AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin...
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@JetBlue Hey friends! Stupid question - Can I split payment methods for a flight purchase? Example: 1/2 debit card, 1/2 BillMeLate Flightr? Thanks!
@USAirways  but have to return car to clt can I skip my flgjt back tonight from gso to clt and pick up at clt to fll I was told yes
@VirginAmerica fav airline
@SouthwestAir Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn't do work if I wanted to.  Never again.
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
@SouthwestAir Is the 1,750 bonus at 1800Flowers still on or did it expire 2/14/15?
@AmericanAir I can't get ahold of aadvantage reservations.  I need to ticket a reservation that Cancelled Flights soon.  can you help?
@VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego.
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@SouthwestAir I'm concerned that you will Cancelled Flight my flight out of BNA tomorrow am. Should I be?
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@USAirways I believe you. But in all seriousness, what's an acceptable time I should have this expense on my name that wasn't my fault....
@JetBlue I would go for 3rd time to Jamaica to volunteer w/ at risk youth #flyitforward #dc #stpatricksfoundation #rotary
@SouthwestAir Just sent you a DM with the details.
@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
@VirginAmerica I'm pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn't work on iPhone or iPad.don't have a computer #help
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
@AmericanAir Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y?
@JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@USAirways never flying you guys again. your customer service is awful
@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?
@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to you😊 http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
@SouthwestAir needs 2 make me whole Used my tkt back n PHX due 2 rude SNA agent Jacquie Plitt flew @USAirways 2 CABO http://t.co/QxWW1p09a0
@JetBlue Fliers to Gain Access to WSJ Content - @zacks_com http://t.co/GouzrdT7ZF
@USAirways I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight.
@USAirways it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day!
@USAirways Flight 2069 from JFK to Charlotte, then 3750 from Charlotte to Birmingham. 2 previous flights to HSV were Cancelled Flightled.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
@JetBlue THANKS!! Her 80th bday is Saturday. We're having an aviation themed surprise party for her.
@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
@SouthwestAir we are 2 mins from departure of 4125 and no announced update nor an update to on time status. Everyone just standing. #comeon
@united I don't have a milage number. I can't sent my mail to you via DM, you're not following me. I follow you now, so you can sent me a DM
@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
@AmericanAir I did set up notifications through AA &amp; Us airways. still nothing
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@United to start daily #B777-200ER flights from #Newark to #Milan #Malpensa replacing #B767-400ER on 7APR instead 28MAR #avgeek
@JetBlue That's pretty nice. Are flight credits automatically given after the flight? I also wish there were a lounge I could sleep in.
@united "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU
@SouthwestAir Hi! Winter Wx Advisory issued for STL. Snow &amp; Ice &amp; Cold, oh my! Will you issue a travel advisory for that?
@JetBlue u the real MVP http://t.co/jWL26G6lRw
@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for "maintenance" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me.
@AmericanAir great thank you
@AmericanAir And gold status too.
@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
@SouthwestAir I love my Companion Pass (qualified 4th year).  #HollyMais
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@united airlines.On flight UA 1669.Need to make UA 3781.Can u hold the plane for us?
@USAirways duh on baggage claim 2 more hours and counting .. Flights 622 &amp; 1898 http://t.co/DkZl57uPQI
@JetBlue I’m getting an “it depends” vibe. Fair enough!
@USAirways worse experience. Clt to DC. Oversold by 20, lost CARRY ON luggage.Cancelled Flightled connecting flight to NYC. #flydelta
@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated.
@JetBlue I can't call right now. My baby just fell asleep.
@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
@united THANK YOU!
@USAirways XNA has TSA Precheck! Would be nice if your system knew that.
@united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow
@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go.
@SouthwestAir - holding us hostage for about an hour with no updates if they are taking us to NY or not. What's going @southwestair
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
@SouthwestAir so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline?
@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?
@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help.
@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/mFSsh2UHUe” LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!
@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. 😒
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@united you are terrible.
@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB
@AmericanAir oh, yeah. I guess those are two different things. 3 am does weird things to my brain. Thanks again! xox
@SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available?
@SouthwestAir IND website says contact airline for flight 899 tomorrow to ATL. On hold for over an hour. Can you give me any more info?
@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
@USAirways hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate.
@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?
@USAirways Can someone please answer my call. I have been waaaaaaiting!!!
@SouthwestAir you only hear about the bad things. Flying the last to weekends, the flights and crews were awesome. Thank you. 👍👍
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@JetBlue on the plane now!  Hopefully no longer at the mercy of the playlist!  Thanks!
@JetBlue Lekvhg want to see what the cost would be to change to the 430 flight
@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@USAirways I called twice the recording says that it has being delivered to my apt but it is not here ?
@VirginAmerica your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best.
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
@USAirways did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@united you're missin the point! There was no "weather". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim "weather" to get out of hotels. Classy
@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
@JetBlue thank you so much for your effort
@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off.
@VirginAmerica BIG Love/gratitude.mpower w/ http://t.co/1AGR9knCpf weRin #OSCARS2105 VIPswagbags@ #AvalonHollywood http://t.co/ybMbGs0dHn
@JetBlue Of course U know I would like 2 lay you down in a #BedofRoses as long as they're #mint colored! https://t.co/3QYEzHjGsb #brandmance
@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.
@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
@united yea I saw that I'm moving to China and have 5-6 bags will pay whatever but wanted to make sure it was ok to bring that many
@AmericanAir I love your company and your staff is amazing. They just made an uncomfortable situation comfortable
@united clicked on the link and got this? #confused http://t.co/xMAQcucWZl
@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
@AmericanAir been calling all morning. Still can't get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!!
@SouthwestAir can you follow me so I can send you the info?
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@JetBlue Change in the Air for Travelers, Investors - @BloombergNews http://t.co/6redD3vC73
@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
@SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail
@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?
@USAirways thank you very much.
@southwestair #fattuesday Great job celebrating #mardigras today at Atlanta Airport. Another reason I'm nuts for you! http://t.co/8WBzOrRn3C
@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
@SouthwestAir When is the last chance to win #DestinationDragon ???
@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick customer service today. #RefundProcedureNotTooPainful I know that Winter Weather is not your fault.
@JetBlue ah no the staff was perfect this morning at JFK, more sleep for me!! :)
@JetBlue Hello Good afternoon how are you, I need know how much flying for summer from june 13th.
@SouthwestAir @heavenlychc9 I'd at least enjoy a free cocktail...or two.
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@AmericanAir 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse
@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
@JetBlue @NHLBruins repping the Bruins in Cleveland at Rock n Roll HOF &amp; The Christmas Story house #JetBlueBruins http://t.co/JKnWuGJ778
@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
@JetBlue @KyleJudah It doesn't matter who you directed me to. It's the principle of the matter. When I gate checked the stroller it was
@united @airlines. Agents arguing about check bag announcement. Looked for room until seat 20, gave up and walked back to seat 7.Unnecessary
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/y5qE9HcQzT” why.
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
“@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid”haa man
@JetBlue will I be charged a fee to do so?
@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?
@VirginAmerica omg omg😍😍 nonstop Dallas to Austin on virgin✨😱✈️
@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
@SouthwestAir thank you. See u next wednesday in FLL. Save me some peanuts
@JetBlue last sleep in Cali... back to JFK tomorrow night.  Looking forward to an another amazing flight with you all :)
@SouthwestAir Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy.
@JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie
@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
@SouthwestAir I'm scheduled to come back tomorrow, finally but I don't know SWA hasn't flown out of @Fly_Nashville yet but @Delta has
@USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@SouthwestAir Denver to Phoenix, I think we're finally getting ready to take off.
@USAirways Everyone on Flight 669 from LAX to RDU enjoyed waiting an hour &amp; a half in baggage claim for their bags just now
@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
@JetBlue Walked down the hall to Carousel 8...found all bags sitting there. Still no words from crew...signage still not updated
@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
@AmericanAir Please REPLY!  How do you mess up my rebook TWICE???
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
@USAirways agent won't hold for connection arriving Late Flight. 7 min before departure time but 3 min too Late Flight. Flt 1903 gate c19. Disappointed
@JetBlue whose performing at T5
@USAirways Thank you

@USAirways #USAirways So my flight was Late Flight getting into charlotte so i miss my connector to Phoenix thanks again last time I EVER FLY USAIR
@united MIA-EWR #384 😄😄😄 excellent crew. EWR-IAD #3589 😡😡😡 No crew to load bags - waiting w/ door open freezing. 20 mins past departure.
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@SouthwestAir flight yesterday Cancelled Flighted. Got to airport 4am today for an on time flight w was delayed Cancelled Flighted than reinstated which caused
@united flight landed 13 hours ago, 2 more flights CMH-IAD last night and still no bag..could have driven it from CMH
@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@AmericanAir would have been had I seen this before 1130pm EST, when I was sound asleep.
@SouthwestAir I got it added thank you! :)
“@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@VirginAmerica  Flight Booking Problems last second flight for next week from SFO- to SAN any chance you want to gift me a promo code since I love you guys
@united Thank you!
@SouthwestAir shhhh i don't want something else to steal our deal😉
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@USAirways how about a phone # to talk to a real person?
@AmericanAir It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue
@VirginAmerica what is your policy on flying after surgery?  I am still waiting for answer so I can tell me doctor.
@SouthwestAir I will do just about anything tO GO TO THE VEGAS SHOW PLEASE MAN
@USAirways flight 623 den to phx: flight attdt decides to stay downtown and be an hour Late Flight so entire flight delayed, she better get fired!
@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
@JetBlue Are departing flights from Boston heavily delayed? Flying out tomorrow morning ...
@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@SouthwestAir - wow! 100 minutes on hold, so far. Now phone is dying...
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD
@AmericanAir "sorry you were disappointed" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
@united not happening.  Delta took care of us.  Peace!
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a "snow storm in Denver". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+
@JetBlue that selfie was extreme.
@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
@SouthwestAir Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.
@SouthwestAir Fantastic! Thank you!
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@USAirways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1
@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your "Premier" groups might be an indication of a broken process.
@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography
@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival
@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
@JetBlue good morning sunshine! #TailfinThursday http://t.co/Nc0ES6e4Lf
@USAirways 4 hours on hold to change a Cancelled Flightled flight. Completely unacceptable!!!
@SouthwestAir I love you guys, but even Comcast has a better phone help system. A simple callback system would fix most of the problem...
@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why...
@USAirways TYVM USAir, Happy Night@ &lt;3
@VirginAmerica great. Well deserved.
@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard "your bag has not been located." 😩
@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@VirginAmerica That's classy.
@SouthwestAir when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us.
@JetBlue messaged you, thanks
@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was "There is nothing we can do" idk if that's what you mean
@SouthwestAir  Flight today from PHL to DAL Cancelled Flightled. 96 min on hold, rebooked for tomorrow. Now that flight is Cancelled Flightled.  On hold again.
Welllllll.... RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dHHomG2kiX
@united not the case. Now delayed due to "mechanical issues with no update on departure time". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta
@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@SouthwestAir @SwagglikeBean take me here
@USAirways Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight?
@JetBlue I thought the same thing after I sent it
@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!
@SouthwestAir not frustrated, just an idea! Great crew. Thanks! #happycustomer
@United "delayed due to customer service" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help!
@AmericanAir why was my flight from Miami to Dallas Monday  rescheduled to Tuesday?
@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)” Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;)
@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.Direct email?
That would be great! I never thought I'd be the sort who'd be into them, but it really makes the flying experience more bearable @JetBlue
@USAirways Can you help me with a refund.  the phone guy couldn't help.  The website won't let me submit a reply.
@JetBlue That makes two of us! Lol #Blushing
@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
@SouthwestAir Please start charging for carryon luggage. #CarryOnBagsSlowEverybodyDown
@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful.
@USAirways @Truthh4 they didn't give you the wifi password? Smh
@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response, we got it resolved at the counter.
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
@USAirways dealing w fam emergency. Was told was rebooked this am to AA flight 4297 out of ORD and now it's not in system. Need help ASAP.
@SouthwestAir took delivery of N8661A, a new Boeing 737-8H4 yesterday. http://t.co/5z9STyUQJ3 #DFW #DAL #airlines
@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.
@SouthwestAir Heard apology ~45 times in the &gt;60 mins I was on hold. Now flying from another airport at a different time but delayed AGAIN
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay.
@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!
@USAirways @AmericanAir call the number listed? sure! by next Friday, I should get a real live person on the line http://t.co/8TJUuM22dD
@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
@SouthwestAir guess where Ashley is. She's doing a great job presenting. #ragandisney http://t.co/5ZNMwxDI9U
@JetBlue thank you will do!! You guy are awesome!
@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
@JetBlue at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled
@JetBlue what is the Mosiac 800 #?
@SouthwestAir http://t.co/tTXRSyNLxr doesn't work on my flight. Just fyi.
@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
@JetBlue is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight.
@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you.
@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far
@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that "slight delay" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation.
@JetBlue great flight http://t.co/E0R0NTO4TR
Power Moves RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/t9s68korSN
@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@united been good 15yr "friendly skies" relationship. 2day agent told me I'm "only Canadian" and thus not good enough for military preboard
@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage
@VirginAmerica We're on flight 910 Vegas to Boston today, checked in online but our bag count didn't register. Can I fix that somehow?
@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne.
@AmericanAir can I get a free ticket to Hawaii for being fabulous
@united any news?
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
@USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
@JetBlue so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue @airlinequality #skytrax http://t.co/tU9JX2jaZN
@JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note
@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
“@VirginAmerica: @KarinSLee Of course. Have fun celebrating!” Thanks! Happy Chinese New Year!
@JetBlue I put it my "to" and "from" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my "to" and "from" airports.
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@SouthwestAir so when do we find out who won the imagine dragons contest?
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day
@SouthwestAir Customer Centricity is knowing people #ANAMarketers
@JetBlue Thank you!
@AmericanAir is flight 1318 Cancelled Flighted or not? No word from the ground staff.
@AmericanAir Can you provide guidance on how I should work with them to resolve the issue
@SouthwestAir the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
@USAirways been trying for weeks no use
@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
@united rude rude
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. 😔
@JetBlue It is physically impossible to make it to the airport, and our flight is scheduled to leave in less than 3 hours.
@USAirways after 2 hrs of trying to reach real human, finally did and been on hold for 1:36 hrs for out of synch reservation.
@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
@united Done and done
@SouthwestAir About time...and just in time for my next flight Thursday.
@SouthwestAir officially on hold for 2 hours!
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Flight 2646.  Four hours in the plane on the ground at BWI.
@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@JetBlue There's a large family of birds inside T5. Are they fed? Are they there for a purpose?
@VirginAmerica is helping me step up my @Tinder game! #TinderTips #tinderchamp http://t.co/jBmVVha63A
@JetBlue The Magic eight ball has never steered me wrong  :)
@united need assistance to change flight to get to an ailing parent..have flight leaving Tuesday need to change ASAP to sooner #custserv
@USAirways Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight tomorrow and not reFlight Booking Problems me on another one. #usairwaysfail
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
@JetBlue Will do.  I'll tell him you say hey.
@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
@JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please?
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@JetBlue Great flight, as always! Thank you to the great crew on flight 475! #travel #jetblue
@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
@SouthwestAir In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address.
@JetBlue Haha. I figured that. I was meaning there's no return flights out of Charlotte. It's like N/A for a week plus
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@JetBlue @JayVig YES! Great real-time example. Thanks for being awesome, #JetBlue! #JVMChat
@VirginAmerica is flight 882 Cancelled Flightled and what do I do if it is?
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.😡
@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?
seriously, I want to work on the JetBlue social team RT @JetBlue: @vincenzolandino http://t.co/eiGaJyzcW2
@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
@VirginAmerica This is what you missed @NewsVP. Next trip to the 407.
@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
@united Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787.
@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!
@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?
@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
@VirginAmerica Good point!
@JetBlue will you Cancelled Flight tonight's 7 pm out of DFW to BOS? #weather
@VirginAmerica thank you! See y'all soon! I'm excited to see the expansion of destinations. Spread those wings!
@USAirways any idea when flight 703 to Miami will leave for a second time?
@USAirways - almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer?
@united following
@USAirways been on hold way to long!  Is this the best level of service you can provide? - one hour+ is too long!
@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
@VirginAmerica really wish you'd fly out of #Fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
@united just added one. Ty
@SouthwestAir how can I check to see if my flight to NYC is expected to be delayed or Cancelled Flightled for this Tuesday?
@AmericanAir Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I'm here @ChicagoMidway airport.  I've waited 3 hours for my bag. No one knows shit. Mgmt knows nothing.  #Very mad customer
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening.
@USAirways @KieranMahan needs two nights at a hotel in phoenix until he can get back to Philly because of plane equipment, crazy!
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I managed to get sorted out over the phone. Good luck dealing with the snow in Texas!
@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
@SouthwestAir CEO using #Vegas band to help ‘connect’ to people. http://t.co/89gKYuf1Qh  #aviation #business #marketing #consumermarketing
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
@USAirways #695 might have been Cancelled Flighted? mechanical issue. 6 hours Late Flightr 100 people still waiting and Zero information. Please send help.
Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@americanair 30 minutes since landing - flight 1531 from Miami and no luggage- what's the delay
@united @annricord both!
@VirginAmerica Thanks! Good times there and back! #Vodkatonics the entire flight🍸#sfo
@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate

“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/XASPqDsqhE”
@americanair hi, you Cancelled Flightled our flight back to the US and now won't take our call. What are we supposed to do?
@AmericanAir just hoping/praying for a safe flight. They've had to stop and de-ice our plane yet again😞
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable.
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@JetBlue @pilyoc dont talk about my friend @JetBlue like that. #thefutureisweird
@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
@USAirways I’ve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?
@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
@USAirways fuck you.
@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.
@SouthwestAir unveils 4 new routes, including  2 from #Ohio http://t.co/4uRzvBPJKO via @usatoday
.@USAirways worst experience of all time. Will never, ever, ever travel with you again. EVER
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@SouthwestAir thanks for getting me home from Denver tonight despite the snow!
@united so what's the solution?
@AmericanAir Eventually the call got through. Not sure what changed. Thank you a lot though!
@united Okay, thank you both.
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
@USAirways delays to the max
@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
@SouthwestAir lost bag on flight to Vegas. Now to El Paso. Going to Dallas love. Gate attendant said see if can coordinate to get it to Love
@united Thanks!
@USAirways waiting for you to figure it out. This is unacceptable.
@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP
@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes.
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
@united You guys are atrocious.  Far better service as silver on Delta than you as a platinum.  I'll be switching back to delta.
@SouthwestAir too Late Flight now
@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@AmericanAir thanks... I finally got through this afternoon.  :)
@united Worst airline ever?
@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
@AmericanAir can you?
@AmericanAir is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
@AmericanAir Hahaha.... "Meanwhile in Russia...."
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@SouthwestAir I fly back to Omaha for my grandmothers funeral, you Cancelled Flight my return flight and dont bother to notify me. Thanks a lot.
@USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.
@SouthwestAir Just realized I had the wrong departure date. Thanks for making changes easy!
@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20).
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
@AmericanAir thanks for reFlight Booking Problems me on a flight and then leaving my luggage in NYC. Unbelievable.
@USAirways my wife left her phone on flight AWE474 on Friday February 20th upon landing in Minneapolis. How can we get it back? Thanks!
@SouthwestAir  @TheEllenShow @Imaginedragons  @kdepetro313 .what a great first night. #DestinationDragons http://t.co/N3LrFo4UaY
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
@AmericanAir My connecting flight to DFW was Cancelled Flightled and need to get to IND tomorrow. Any way I can get this sorted out? Been holding 1h08
@USAirways thanks! http://t.co/pD7R1lL6Re
@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
@SouthwestAir Had to pay a $25 fare difference on a change but can't seem to find the receipt for it. How can I get a copy for reimbursement
@SouthwestAir :( Thanks for the opportunity...
@USAirways flight #3739 leaving CVG. Gate agent had no computer and counted passengers on paper. I feel safe.
@AmericanAir trying to talk 2 customer service to add lap child and can't get a hold of anybody. I need help!!!!!
@JetBlue - I will for sure. But my TSA-Pre works with other airlines. Why is Jetblue different?
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
@SouthwestAir @AARP @JimCramer 75yo mom says, "Hire more staff to accommodate your audience" You could learn lots from her. She's off to FL
@USAirways 4473.  She just called to say it's a runway clearing problem of all things.
@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
@AmericanAir Flight 2954, Dallas to Grand Junction #AmazingFlightCrew

@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@SouthwestAir  flying Southwest for the first time to LGA with a layover in Atlanta!
@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated
@SouthwestAir crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight
@AmericanAir Can you tell me what that means? I work and just need an estimated time of arrival please? I need my laptop for work. Thanks
@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! 🙌✈️
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@USAirways not Cancelled Flightling #837 because you don't want to put us in a hotel for night is our guess
@SouthwestAir can't update my flight online bc it's been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold.
@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?
@SouthwestAir I am trying to book another flight and apply my credits that I had from another flight but I can't find them.
@VirginAmerica ...Please come to Minneapolis St. Paul!
@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?
2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
@JetBlue I can't wait to hear back from you regarding the internship opportunity! 😊
@SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@AmericanAir 2days 2plains 2fails
@AmericanAir now I understand!!
@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour.
@VirginAmerica save some for 871 tomorrow AM!
@SouthwestAir planning a family trip to Orlando in May and trying to figure out when to book to get the best rate. Any Suggestions?
@SouthwestAir about time! Thank you!
@AmericanAir Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@USAirways we have seats.  on phone Iwas  told I was getting error msg due to paid 1st class upgrd. told to check in after 12am.sound right?
@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/
@VirginAmerica thanks for that. Been needing a way to make those Austin trips from DCA, and now you've come through!
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@USAirways terrible service
@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks.
@SouthwestAir greetings
@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care
@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
@USAirways the entire flight crew on flight 738 from BOS to PHL is doing a wonderful job and making this experience not totally suck. 😊
@JetBlue that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are "dead air".
@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU
@USAirways yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours
@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.
I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA
@USAirways using all of my monthly minute on hold with you assholes
@SouthwestAir neveind, it's been found and on its way. Thanks for making the process so painless
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@JetBlue: So excited to hear about your move towards international travel from Long Beach Airport!
@americanair never fails to disappoint. waiting at jfk an hour after scheduled take off and still no word on departure
@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
@USAirways how do you manage to place a family of 5 into a plain with none of them sitting next to each other one of them being a 3yr old
@VirginAmerica Atlantic ploughs a lone furrow in the #MiddleEast http://t.co/vw4P4T4tLh @TheNationalUAE
@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for "weather" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ar0VayLmFc” Really Jet Blue? Lmao
@USAirways @jtrexsocial i fell asleep from a call i placed midght.. guess what still on hold 7 am
@USAirways First class service on US 769 PHL-MCO today from the flight attendant in F. I didn't catch her name but she was top notch!
@USAirways 45 minute delay for take off and 30 minute wait for checked bags? Really?
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!
@SouthwestAir me &amp; @sammi_jon3s are best friends because of @Imaginedragons. Any chance we could get tickets to #DestinationDragons ?
@AmericanAir but they refused to unload our luggage so we're stuck in below freezing weather w/o our cold weather clothes.
@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)
@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted
@JetBlue I'm looking every day just watching for a deal. I have specific dates so fare finder doesn't help me
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
@JetBlue Can you do me a huge favor?!🙏❤️
@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
@JetBlue woof.
@USAirways once again your company actualy put people in weird situations.Your hostel voucher was fake.Snow is ok but no lies please
@AmericanAir Thanks!
“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” free tickets , for the i convince .
@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!
@JetBlue we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@united can you make sure I’m on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
@VirginAmerica I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!!   Let me out of here!
@JetBlue becomes first #airline to accept #Apple Pay - Future #Travel Experience http://t.co/czOr4nyh9n
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss oh my gosh
@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to...
@USAirways hour 4 at the gate.
@USAirways of course! "Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@USAirways Commitment to excellence is 2b praised. Can get you to the wrong city 2 days Late Flight or the right one 3 days Late Flight. #customerservice
@SouthwestAir you have the worst service, you Cancelled Flightled all your flights FLL to PHL all @USAirways flights flew. Stuck in FL 3 days. #done
@JetBlue your employee Charles cave at the gate at MSY went above and beyond to help try to help me find my glasses. Thought u should know
@VirginAmerica hi! I just bked a cool birthday trip with you, but i can't add my elevate no. cause i entered my middle name during Flight Booking Problems 😢
@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst
@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????
@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@SouthwestAir fortunately didn't have to. The flight took off on time.
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
.@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys "misplaced" my bag. Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly.
@SouthwestAir please please please choose me to go see @Imaginedragons   #DestinationDragons
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
@USAirways Does your company see passengers as customers or just $$$?
@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
More like BaeJet Airways, amirite?“@JetBlue: @terrybrokebad Right back at ya!”

@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts "why this person was talking to her".
@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I 💙 you!
@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow
@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
@united Is your company motto: "I do not care!!!"  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week."  #idonotcare
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
@JetBlue honestly I’m glad you didn’t Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I’ll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
@SouthwestAir BTW, not a weather delay. We've had beautiful weather in Sunny California. #nolove #noexcuses #cali http://t.co/kumtbgER03
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.
@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.

@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
@USAirways was on the phone for over an hour waiting without an answer. 😩
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
Eliza &amp; I cheated on u @AmericanAir with @AirTahitiNui &amp; it was a lovely flight. But we'll be back! Lots!
@USAirways hundreds of people in line and less than half the desks being manned at CLT. Help?
@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
@JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.
@AmericanAir the saga continues..
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
@SouthwestAir horrible flight!
@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
@united direct messages not going through please help
@SouthwestAir needs to offer a college student discount so i can fly home 😭😭
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
@AmericanAir what can AA do for a load of people about to board their 5th plane of a very long day when the first 4 were unserviceable
@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
@SouthwestAir oh look you just delayed our flight an additional half hour now arriving at 6 officially five hours after planned. 😡😡😡😡😤😤😤
@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
But I don't see AA @united
@AmericanAir Uhmmm we need @JColeNC down in Dallas,Tx for his tour 😫😫😫
@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
@united perfect! Thank you!
@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
@VirginAmerica sounds like fun !
@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?
@SouthwestAir We've been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I'm telling Herb.
@JetBlue I would love for you to fly my best friend home to PVD for a weekend. 😊 http://t.co/cH0NmjyMgh
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 20 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation. Can you assist?
@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@JetBlue Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info.
@USAirways thanks to Betty working gate at ILM and lovely gate agents here in CLT helping me get home 2 Phx tonight instead of tomorrow
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@JetBlue wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX&gt;JFK tomorrow. Can you help?
@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny
@SouthwestAir My Fav!!!!
@JetBlue what is the name of this tailfin? http://t.co/qxV45MV0Ug
@SouthwestAir "Will my luggage be on that flight?" "No" "Y not" "bc ur on that flight n it won't end up where ur goin http://t.co/6Zj6L2ZTua
@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
@SouthwestAir I just received your birthday card.  It was amazing and made me smile with joy.  Nice videos.  Thanks.
@USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail
@JetBlue 290 to Boston
@united and a husband.
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
@USAirways Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems
@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain
@JetBlue it seems I never received an ID, just a password.
@SouthwestAir your social media team just said "sorry". Thankfully submitting a complaint got resolution from an amazing rep who called.
@AmericanAir thanks so much!
@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after
@USAirways what is the damn delay????
@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?
@JetBlue That's why I love JetBlue! #truebluemember4life
@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
@united thanks for delaying our flight for an hour, missing our connecting flight and terrible customer service. #neveragain #vacation
@USAirways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6
@USAirways Your CLT baggage crew deserves a #kudos. I had to run to make my connection. And my bags still made it! #CustomerService
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight 😕
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/IMVMpnQXAI
@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
@JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights.
@AmericanAir @MattThomasNews When did American Airlines start flying to and from Siberia? Wait, this is the USA? Oy!
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@AmericanAir See photo of B787 scale model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/kfD4WQRkLW
@JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@AmericanAir Always love opening the upgrade email.
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@AmericanAir if business class if full but 1st class empty, do you guys upgrade EXP members to 1st?
@JetBlue yes, We have de baggage claim, I'm so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us 😞 please we need That baggage
@USAirways been on hold 2 hours for a Cancelled Flighted flight. I understand the delay. I don't understand you auto-reFlight Booking Problems me on TUESDAY. HELP!
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
@VirginAmerica On all your flights?
@USAirways - flights 4500 AND 403 delayed for "crew availability?"  What gives? I'm getting to TPA 2.5 hrs past my scheduled arrival.
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
@united thanks, just sent :)
@USAirways tell my professors that when I don't show up to class/write my midterm because I'm stuck with no flights home 😠
@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@SouthwestAir I (heart) my CP status. Sure would be nice to have though.
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
@JetBlue *fights air*
@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
@AmericanAir those were snacks we left on purpose for your team. :) for being so helpful this morning at the desk and on the phone!
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all
@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/jm4GeyXbY5”LOL
@JetBlue definitely!
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood - Carrie!
@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
@SouthwestAir the new logo is going to look amazing on the airplanes
@USAirways telling a man theres NO FLIGHTS for the next 10 hrs!!! NO standby! NOTHING! NO OPTIONS! trying to get to sick child! #FireVan!
@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?
@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that "really there are 3 not 4 seats"
@JetBlue you bet:)
@AmericanAir if i want to change my flight due to weather conditions in Dallas this weekend, i should be able to cover change fee with miles
@JetBlue I have an email that says I have to sign on to the travel bank?  How do I that?
@SouthwestAir can I please go see @Imaginedragons on friday? I promise I'll only fly Southwest when going back home to NH #MHTforlife
@JetBlue okay. The new screens are laptop-large &amp; real nice &amp; the wifi is appreciated. Thanks god for this tiny lil man in the middle seat.
@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
@SouthwestAir Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance?
@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc
@USAirways How does flight 680 look? I'm hearing about Cancelled Flightled departures from @Reagan_Airport and I'm about to head into it
@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
@AmericanAir my flight number is 3M 50
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@JetBlue So anything found while cleaning the plane in DC would be at the baggage office, even something small?
@USAirways hello! I never received a confirmation code for my flights (though they are confirmed--so says the automated reply). Any ideas?
@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
@JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC
@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
@JetBlue when I check in tomorrow morning for my flight on wens can I automatically add it to passbook?
@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@JetBlue thank you
@VirginAmerica I miss the #nerdbird in San Jose
@USAirways nervous for flight tomrw out of key west not friendly customer service
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Daily Journal http://t.co/9bzqZQx8DC
@VirginAmerica you should have 39 dollar LAX-Las fares!!!
@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine well deserved!
@USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
💯💯💯 RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/SrM13qbRZD
@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA.
@USAirways what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American?
@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.
@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back.
@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
@USAirways Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told " I don't feel like dealing with it" 😒
@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
“@AmericanAir: @RussellsWriting Russ, please contact Reservations at 800-433-7300 for reFlight Booking Problems options.” Good luck with that!
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
@AmericanAir okay. I just sent it.
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!!
@SouthwestAir  over 15 minutes without talking to a human at what point would you recommend I call @AmericanAir http://t.co/ysqbVq6Mgb
@JetBlue Come on and provide service from Destin- Fort Walton Beach Airport
@SouthwestAir when will dates to fly go past August 7 2015?
@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this "service" is acceptable. #customerservicefail
@AmericanAir  ugh Dump us in dfw w/no luggage then Cancelled Flight our flight 3 more times. Sat arrival now Tue?
@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
@JetBlue Longing to look into the blue eyes. #firstlove
@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
STOP THIS “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn”
@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
@VirginAmerica you have the absolute best team and customer service ever.  Every time I fly with you I'm delighted.  Thank you!
@JetBlue WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO
@AmericanAir @British_Airways 2 weeks ago today i arrived in miami and I still don't have my bag, absolute disgrace!
@united Can you please follow for a Dm on a missing bag?
@united I was. But I have given up.
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset
@USAirways I packed a carry on for a reason. Thanks for making me check it. I hoped for better customer service in CLE also. #nothappy
@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind.
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
@AmericanAir I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ❤️ these earrings!!
@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
@united is pri boarding for "Active Military" or only "In Uniform?" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel
@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@United, #deaffriendly? Getting there. Read your review on http://t.co/2Brt0aTHaU: http://t.co/WzNp5q1M0H
@USAirways ur "response" was: my "inconvenience was of no matter." U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair
@SouthwestAir Whats up with flight 4464 Ft myers to milwaukee???
@JetBlue I have a little more time then that..lol. Well actually a lot more. 36 days more. But I'm just excited!!
@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
@AmericanAir when is next lax JFK flight today
@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +
@USAirways Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight. Been on hold for over 1 hr
@SouthwestAir any chance I can get tix for @VelourLive @Imaginedragons? I have been tweeting since January 26 about it #DestinationDragons
"LOL you guys are so on it" - me, had this been 4 months ago...“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/LYcARlTFHl”
@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir seeing your workers time in and time out going above and beyond is why I love flying with you guys. Thank you!
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@JetBlue why won't the site let me book tickets for nov for jfk to kin?
@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
@JetBlue do you have mint service from NYC to San Diego?
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@AmericanAir a friend is having flight Cancelled Flightlations out of LAX to CMH on Feb 23. Anyway to help her? 800 number has been no help
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@SouthwestAir absolutely required? Are the flights going to be 100% Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
@JetBlue C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@SouthwestAir Boooo!!!!!!   Don't be like the other airlines!!  http://t.co/WHAGPknnLF
@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis
@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
@united sent DM's
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)
@JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘🆘
@SouthwestAir  goes to court to gain access to @Delta gates at Love Field  http://t.co/ILqzmMJiYQ #deltanews
@AmericanAir I've been doing this all night. Can someone please help? I need my flt fixed. Please???
@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH
@united never again.
@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
@united  Need to change flight from this Tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in FL, Need help!! #custserv
@USAirways Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight
Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options.
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service
@USAirways I will be traveling from LAX to CLT to HTS, I have been rebooked for tomorrow due to the travel advisory.
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.
@JetBlue PDX to JFK was suuuuper HOT.
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@SouthwestAir my trip is a month away...why do you consider it "around the corner"? Is that a setting I can change?
@VirginAmerica is my new go to airline
@united hoping to get out earlier than 2/23 (only phone option) or assistance with hotel.
@USAirways Flight 4424 operated by @FlyRepublicAir (N813MA) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from Reagan National http://t.co/OSc9OFlol3
@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
“@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we’ll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/WBMHRl3bvl
@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?
@SouthwestAir not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service.
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
..... Can you not? “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/udPq0flIQo”
@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available
@JetBlue Done! Also looks like you opened some up on my flight to Vegas on Sunday! 💙
@USAirways can you add my KTN to an existing reservation?
@jetblue are going to let Fl382 into a gate in BOS any time soon? We're just sittin' here on the tarmac  waiting.
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
@united terrible travel experience. Traveled 8000 miles roundtrip but two Cancelled Flightlations of short hops cost me two days
@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
@JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it’s the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather.
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
@JetBlue Aw okay thanks
@USAirways your ticket agents at gate 4 in Providence airport rocked tonight, especially Kristy, sorry if that is not the correct spelling.
@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
@SouthwestAir I DM'd you
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie 😄
@SouthwestAir I dunno my travel information.. like what?
@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?
@SouthwestAir please please please http://t.co/xiJiFYmvqP
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@JetBlue Awesome thanks! Thanks for the quick response. You guys ROCK! :)
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@SouthwestAir Great job with the Passbook integration! It’ll really help streamline the commute to San Fran! 😊☕📲✈
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  love all three but you really can't beat the classics!
No no no bad airline bad! *bops you with newspaper* “@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid”
@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
@united Got a call. Bag is to be delivered tonight. Thanks for your reply!!
@SouthwestAir Ahhhh! Sorry, just followed.
@SouthwestAir hi, can you please tell me why today's flights from Chicago to DIA were Cancelled Flightled? Thanks!
@USAirways in 140 characters? Yea right.   Thanks for patronizing.
@AmericanAir Traveling with my infant: Do you check the carseat for free? If so, do you provide a bag? Someone told me but wanted to confirm
@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.
@united yes, you can. I will DM.
@USAirways This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure http://t.co/ef4P0HISHb
@USAirways thank you so much for asking us to pay $700 to switch to a different flight so I could spend more time with my dying nephew.
@AmericanAir 🙏 in my hotel now. Thank you!
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@SouthwestAir What are your services? What promotion you have at the moment? #ModeloDeNegocio #innovation #innovacion #BusinessModel
@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
@SouthwestAir when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th???
@SouthwestAir No worries at all!!! I would rather be safe on the ground than take any chances. Yes! Tomorrow AM if BNA reopens ☺️
@SouthwestAir How do I retroactively add previous flights/miles/points to current rapid rewards balance?
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@SouthwestAir have you considered adding the "we'll call you back when we have someone free" feature to your support line?
“@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.” #false
@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@SouthwestAir do you have a pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in Atlanta?! I'd love to go! #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir thank you. Please follow and I will send.
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@JetBlue try harder. Take a winners attitude to your work.
@SouthwestAir too long to wait for bags when they could have been on the next flight out. The party of 4 could have waited in Albany
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@USAirways Now going on 26 minutes on hold.
@SouthwestAir departing MDW it's cold 26F, windy with snow on the ground for sunny and 70F las vegas  @LASairport http://t.co/2IR7ynMBdU
@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
@USAirways - been on hold for more than 2.5 hours - this after not getting through after 2 hours on hold this morning with no answer - help!
@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)
@JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@JetBlue ticket issued whilst delivering your customers.
@SouthwestAir Not your finest moment in Boston right now!
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
@SouthwestAir follow for a DM please. Need to confirm a Cancelled Flighted reservation
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?
@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
@AmericanAir =UNAmerican Airlines just lies and poor customer services...
@AmericanAir my seat is disgusting. Old and dirty. When are you going to refurbish this plane?  US Air 597 jfk to phx
@USAirways  and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta.
@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
@AmericanAir seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr
@JetBlue Airways Hits New 52-Week High at $17.58 (JBLU) - sleekmoney http://t.co/zdKXn4kTOu
@SouthwestAir  also, gave up after 1 hr 32 minutes on hold. Maybe put a few more people on it?
@SouthwestAir not at all. Rerouted to snowy BWI been trying to figure out how to get out of here. Now dealing with more baggage troubles.
@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
@united Hi have a question re future Flight Booking Problems. DUB-JAC 29/9 JAC-LAX 8/10 LAX-DUB 13/10. I'm *G. What is checked bag allowance for JAC-LAX?
@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@united Followback so I can DM plz
@SouthwestAir Can you equip a 737 with flamethrowers and a snow plow?
@SouthwestAir I am just wondering when are you going to open up fares for November?
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
@USAirways If my flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled every week I might as well be in business class.
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!
@VirginAmerica Trying to reset my password, email never arrives. Help?
@SouthwestAir think you need to follow me for a DM
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
@SouthwestAir very confusing to receive "your trip is around the corner!" email when I already Cancelled Flightled the flight
@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo
@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway—why not just put thru baggage claim?
@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
@JetBlue I would prefer a similar picture but full of E190 tails, but great shot!
@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos.
@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt
@AmericanAir .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage  #AmericanAirlines
@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family
@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
@USAirways missing our connection due to delay out of @LAS. Told not looking good for tmrw either. We will be stuck in #CLT. Help!
@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
@united hello I am flying first class and am behind 20 people on zone 1!!!!!  Pls pass on to app dept - you should board 1st class first
@SouthwestAir is Flight 3113 OMA&gt;DEN on 2/21 actually Cancelled Flightled? Been on hold for over an hour and your website says conflicting messages
@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
@JetBlue Indeed. It was not 😉.
@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to "plan your trip page"regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems processhint: the end of it
@SouthwestAir Thank you. The email about RR pts &amp; how to gain more wasn't clear so all of mine r gone. Anything u can do is appreciated.
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
@SouthwestAir There's nothing I love more than being on hold for over an hour http://t.co/LIQWoblFbT
@JetBlue  will do.
@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago.
@SouthwestAir your flight attendants are really funny!! The sass is giving me life!!! 😂
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
@HillAConlin @SouthwestAir hi! get a solar charger from Amazon! Game changer to plug usb into charge. :)
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@SouthwestAir my parents flight frm STL2ATL Cancelled Flighted 2nite. When's the next one out?!
@JetBlue no I asked. Either way it doesn't make the flight less delayed.
@SouthwestAir flight to PHL from FLL Cancelled Flighted 2/21 no flight available until 2/24 done with SW.
@AmericanAir @dfwairport  Have been trying to get canx flight resched since noon.  got 2 call backs but call disconnects as soon as I answer
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn’t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@USAirways There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I'm not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info?
@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.
@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
@SouthwestAir Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston.
@USAirways Another great flight #FunFlightAttendants. Thanks for showing my dad wonderful customer service. #flt635 #LAX #PHX #SundayFunday
@united mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can't DM for some reason.)
@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
@SouthwestAir  Just sent DM. Thanks for your attentiveness to this matter.
@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
@JetBlue do you have any afternoon flights going from BQN to JFK? I only seem to find early morning flights.
@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
@JetBlue I like Marie Harf go to Iraiq find ISIS and spread good, and offer resume service to ISIS in order to find jobs @marieharf
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
@USAirways Thank you. And thanks for being so accommodating.
@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that "sandwich."
@AmericanAir @USAirways Statement wasn't sent yesterday like Jeanine said. After I even called last night as well. Again, excellent service
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
@SouthwestAir for the win as always- saved my day and got me on a direct to Orlando. 🎉🎉🎉
@AmericanAir yes, I will do just that as soon as I have a moment to gather my thoughts.
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
Happy for SFO, but hopefully you'll add PDX soon “@JetBlue We added two new destinations (FLL and SFO) from Las Vegas in the last year!”
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Alaska Highway News http://t.co/tynchOeLac
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@JetBlue @jeff_hofmann @DeniseJTaylor @LaurieAMeacham Good one! And indeed, it's JetBlue's finest day in history!
@USAirways horrible customer service, flying from Miami to Philadelphia, sent to Charlotte, now can't get out of Charlotte!
@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
@JetBlue just mine sadly.. But yea the fly fi is awesome
@USAirways @AmericanAir thought u merged but #USAirways sucks #worstever http://t.co/myNZitCovn
@SouthwestAir Are you announcing any more winners to the #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons  show @VelourLive in UTAH this weekend? #Lucky
@AmericanAir boarded flight 2334 at 8:30am.  Now 11:40.  Still sitting on runway.  Lots o fun
@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
@SouthwestAir 5 min away!
@VirginAmerica - amazing customer  service, again! 💕💕 RaeAnn in SF - she's the best! #customerservice #virginamerica #flying
@USAirways 657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby.
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response.
@JetBlue Flight 69 (ha!) - one employee said they were reassigned another said they just left. I just want some warm weather!
@USAirways why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating
@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 😩
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@SouthwestAir never lets me down!!!
@USAirways I didn't make a reservation yet. It's about changing name on my dividend miles account
talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
@united of course but they were just as helpless as everyone else .
@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
@JetBlue it's okay...I'm actually a tea kinda guy anyway. Thanks!
@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.
“@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP” @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues
@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
@SouthwestAir been on hold so long to rebook my Cancelled Flightled flight I had enough time to rebook with @USAirways instead! Lots of room there!
@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it’s not 1997 anymore.
@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
@AmericanAir what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .
@SouthwestAir now our pilots timed out...#getmeoutofhere
@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel
@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.
@SouthwestAir been with my GF for 2.5yrs, she's from SF &amp; I live in Tulsa. SWA always takes me there to see my love! #SouthwestLuvSweeps
@united I must stop my relationship with you. You've become greedy and heartless and our long term relationship is over
@JetBlue Utah, I think. And thanks!
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@AmericanAir for our delays !!! I'm out of more money because of you
@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL
@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@VirginAmerica, @reallytallchris dropped a track on you... https://t.co/zv2pt6TRK9
@JetBlue Thank you Alicia!  #ExceptionalService
@JetBlue is flt 1202 delayed?
@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
@SouthwestAir Are there any current promotions/codes for Nashville-Denver? Thank you!
@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said “It is now.” But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?
@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@AmericanAir Fuck you.
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@SouthwestAir has some of the best airfare prices! Gotta LUV them :)
@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better
@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
@SouthwestAir Just watched crew on flight 380 help elderly lady off plane...#firstclass
@JetBlue I hear that the new thing in your planes are the Fly-Fi. How I can check if the flight that Im going to take have it?
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@USAirways then why did my whole team be able to put there carry ons under the plane
@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.

@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it's just on the nxt flight up. I've got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I'll just turn my sweatshirt inside out
@AmericanAir forgot to select my ksml on my flight to LA and it's a few minutes under the 24 hour mark. Is there any way to change it?
@USAirways - Janet &amp; my DEN-PHL  flight Cancelled Flightled Saturday, USAIR rescheduled automatically &amp; notified us by email at no additional cost.
@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
@USAirways an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
@AmericanAir flight number #2386

@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
@JetBlue I would go to Italy to visit my relatives and see the house my dad left when he passed.
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier
@USAirways link doesn't work and I've tried tracking my bag several times. Still doesn't clarify where it is.
@JetBlue weather where?  It's 60 in SFO and flight 834 is still on time to boston.
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes
Not your fault @JetBlue Social Media Awesome People. I know everyone is working hard to get us in our way.
@JetBlue #JetBlueBOS What's up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS?  Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating.
@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ✌️out.
@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now.
@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@SouthwestAir I have had 4 flights Cancelled Flightled through yall!!!! Im sick of it 😠😠
@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
@AmericanAir I DM'd you
@JetBlue only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can't just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason.
@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
@AmericanAir Thx! I hope so. IAH to DFW to OKC has turned out to be a LONG trip today and I have to work tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol
@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
@SouthwestAir thanks so much just had to make a Cancelled Flightlation! I've sent u the info.
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
@USAirways suggest you failures make a HUGE donation to @the_USO  Charlotte, NC as THEY provided GREAT customer service today, unlike you.
@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
@JetBlue sorry to report we are stuck on Tarmac.. Being held so #notwheelsup
@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... 😉 what about the impossible connection that started this?
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
@SouthwestAir you're going to compensate us for the two plane changes in Atlanta right?
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@AmericanAir make that 7hours now
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
@JetBlue well duh. My grandfather just got hired as a TSA agent and currently at PWM!
😩😩😩 “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/46am1BSi2G”
@AmericanAir can you please help? you've now rebooked me incorrectly after flight was Cancelled Flightled. please fix my flt to Tuesday!!
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@USAirways he waited over two hours on the phone, had to book and get to MI, family member very ill, time of the essence
@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option.
@SouthwestAir yes, please #companionpass
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight &amp; your site is down 😁
@JetBlue Thank you very much!
@JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts?
@SouthwestAir will the Daytona 500 be available on free TV?
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO
@SouthwestAir finally boarded. Looks like I'll make it to my final destination but my baggage won't # baggagefail #bagsflyfreebutnotwithme
@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
@SouthwestAir - Hi Janet in customer service. I'm calling you back and have been sitting in que for 40 mins! Plz pick it up!!! #frustrated
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@VirginAmerica brought it all the way across the country today I see http://t.co/TKaUyGcPmS
@SouthwestAir can you provide direct assistance? My colleague and I cannot re-book b/c the ticket was booked via a corporate account. #help
@usairways I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!!
@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@united Thanks for the update.
@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
@SouthwestAir PLEASE HELP! I would die to see the Vegas show! It would be amazing to hear their songs for real!
@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
@SouthwestAir please please please answer the phone. . .
@USAirways Y'all need to get it together
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled, stuck for 3 days. Paid for "A" boarding. Refused to honor it with rescheduled flight
@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever
@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
@AmericanAir thanks!!
@JetBlue do you have direct flights to and from Bos to St Lucia or Antigua?
@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@SouthwestAir Can you please follow so I can DM? Thx!
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love u Southwest. You've always been helpful. When I traveled a lot w/my son, infant/toddler, U were great!
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@AmericanAir your team rebooked my Cancelled Flightled AA flight on a different airline. New airline has no such Flight Booking Problems. Flight is this evening.
@USAirways so I can make a reservation
@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?
@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@VirginAmerica Results Handily Exceed Forecasts - @NYTimes http://t.co/gonmRwEM6I
@usairways traveling with 2 year old. would appreciate you holding up your end of good business and hosting us in our unanticipated layover.
@AmericanAir I’m still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
@USAirways So any ideas when the IT Geeks will plug in the servers so 639 can be on its way to PHX?
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered
@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
@JetBlue lol at your "estimated departure time." Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right.
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united @AmericanAir THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPEhttp://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ

Cool! "@JetBlue: @hgeronemus We are 60% there and anticipate completing installation on all our A320's this year. http://t.co/sGckBopATA”
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@VirginAmerica first time flying Virgin, went to #SanFrancisco .Thanks for the smooth ride. Easily my new fav airline!
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they’re interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.

@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@AmericanAir 1491 DEN -&gt; DFW. We don't want to be ticketed on a new flight, just refunded for our Cancelled Flighted flight.
@USAirways , I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example
@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons @beatsmusic well timed tweet, just boarded and will be listening on my way home!
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@AmericanAir No apology necessary. It was wind and I was on Delta. XOXO

@SouthwestAir Already signed up!  Thanks!  Looking forward to trying the Southwest experience.
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are

@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!

“@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN” I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told "we can't find a supervisor."
@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
@jetblue had me on hold foreverrrrrr
@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
@USAirways OK she is worried that something is wrong with the flight - #1870 - and should she consider flying earlier
@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?

@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.
@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
@USAirways we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't.
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cRFrwpc1Sx”😂😂😂
@AmericanAir it's not only my bag...it's the complete lack of respect when I called. I was hung up on. And it is my daughters bag
@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tomorrow at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is flight overbooked? Have funeral to attend!

@SouthwestAir will do - if you follow back I can DM that info
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.

@USAirways Flight 1815 (N747UW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @PHLAirport http://t.co/TtLwZgIyAg
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?
thanks to @USAirways my trip is all screwed up. Ive had to move meetings and a dinner and im STILL not out of nyc yet
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
@SouthwestAir your "complimentary" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
“@AmericanAir Thanks for info on super large passengers- the extra seat Mr. Big needed was the one i was sitting in already #customerservice
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable 😐
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited

Bruh...real tweet from @JetBlue "Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dqny4aKTg9"
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@united am I allowed to bring a duffle bag and back pack as my carry on and personal item? Flying out of NY
@united finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it!
@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?
@USAirways 24 hrs Late Flightr still not home. Hotel, rental car etc with a 5 yr old, what happened to "customer service is our first priority"
@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. This day and age message through Twitter travels fast.
@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
@JetBlue will I be compensated for delays or Cancelled Flightlation?
@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won’t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go…?
@AmericanAir Fantastic support by the Twitter team. I appreciate it. Thanks again.
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad.
@SouthwestAir thank you!!!
@USAirways  where's my bag?  In line 200 deep at DCA. Agents say call 800 #.  800# says talk to agents. Abysmal customer service
@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@SouthwestAir thank you, will do
@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???
@SouthwestAir Pls help. On hold 4 long time now. Travelling 4 business and flight 2 ORF from MCI was Cancelled Flightled.  Need to get out there ASAP.
@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@USAirways This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace.
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
@JetBlue flight for tomorrow morning Cancelled Flighted &amp; can't seem to rebook me. They can't even get me a seat. No clear answer on why Cancelled Flighted.
@JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@USAirways if ur going 2 charge $20 for wi-fi make sure it works. #Brutal #DialUp b a 100 by the time things load. #TheEnd #GoodDay
@SouthwestAir understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help
@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@united can I access Frankfurt arrival lounge when I'm flying global first class?
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@AmericanAir LTALJX, from DCA to OMA this morning. All of the staff that helped me fix my problem were so helpful. #goodthingscome #thanks
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though.
@AmericanAir With snow/ice forecast DFW Tu pm-We am what is change policy on reservations we hold Wed morning? Any leeway??
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
@AmericanAir it looks like a mistake
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@SouthwestAir So that's what happens when your power level goes over 9,000... feet in the air.
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
@united it's my 21st birthday and my sister is coming to celebrate but her flights keep Cancelled Flighting PLZ do all you can to get her here!!!!
@JetBlue mint seats are AWESOME! :-) @emaleesugano best business class in the US!!!
@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
@united Ill check it out, appreciate the response, regardless.
@SouthwestAir How many trees have to die before you stop trying to sell us a credit  card? #OptOut http://t.co/CXrZhcdTVz
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
@SouthwestAir FIND A WAY TO Cancelled Flight FLIGHT 310!!!!!!!
@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
@united that's of course in lax
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@USAirways Nick on flight 742 was awesome. Please reward him in some way!!! He has kept us smiling on a bad day of travel. #customerservice
@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@USAirways yes, with Delta!
@VirginAmerica #wtf I paid for direct flight on purpose not to have to stop for fuel exhausted frequent flier and nothing for inconvenience!
@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@SouthwestAir the 5:50 is sold out too?
@SouthwestAir I thought you guys were the best airline...I've been on hold for an hour!
@SouthwestAir app error - says click here, can't click not hyperlinked http://t.co/IH5w9nfKz2
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
@united Hi, I am flying domestic first from SEA to HNL. Can I pay to use the lounge before I fly or this is just for international? Thanks
@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
@SouthwestAir all good now. Going to make it to Boston on time. I'm actually on your wifi right now
@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now.
@JetBlue I'd go to Portsmouth, NH to take care of my friend's son while she takes her daughter to Boston for surgery.  #flyingitforward
@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest.
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
@JetBlue is that supposed to change in the near future?
@united THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPEhttp://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!
@VirginAmerica you have amazing staff &amp; super helpful as I just ran the @WaltDisneyWorld #PrincessHalf they have spoiled me with comfort!!!
@USAirways churn rate increasing by the second
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE 😤#ANGRY
@SouthwestAir Hey sourhwest can you send me to Atlanta to see @Imaginedragons ? I will fly southwest forever. U guys are the best airline!
@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
@JetBlue insane the craziness I've seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue
@united 6533 ORD to DCA
@VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I’m logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 😥.
@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews all the way though @ladygaga was very impressive! NO to @Carrieunderwood
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons Scavenger Hunt Vegas, BE READY!!! http://t.co/vHgkiTzSaw
@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was "no longer available" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC
@united Bag was finally delivered and intact. Thanks for your assistance.
@JetBlue tickets were confirmed and sent out. find out today that they Cancelled Flightled our tickets months ago and never sent an email #jetblue
@JetBlue flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop
@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable
@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
@SouthwestAir do you have all winners for @Imaginedragons #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue no. Please stop.
@SouthwestAir love them! Always get the best deals!
@USAirways #SOS WHERE IS MY BAG ?
@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago…still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!
@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@JetBlue sent :-) curious to see what kind of comp we get.
@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you.
@VirginAmerica If only you guys had flights from CMH.
This shits gotta stop RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/PEQ90pqMpp
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
@SouthwestAir show me some love and a companion flight~please and thank you!
@USAirways Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful
@USAirways couldn't be more thankful to your #orf and #dca crews on the ground and in the air today for help with a sick kid and a lost bag!
@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
@USAirways Seriously? I should keep trying after seven hours. That is your corporate policy? #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir why are you literally the worst?
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
@JetBlue  Brazil to volunteer teaching english &amp; spanish to Poor children so they have a skills to improve their chances of a better life.
@SouthwestAir can one use a companion pass w/ a points Flight Booking Problems or is it only cash fares? Thx!
@AmericanAir Of course you are because that's your companies job! You guys failed at it in the first place. Upgrade me and then we'll talk.
Please don't. RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/gdzadXzBYA”
@southwestair so I saw the promo for A-List when I was on a plane this Monday. I fly two more times in the qualification period. 1/2
@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week.
@united yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I'll figure out car rental changes and such.
@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
@JetBlue and The from @WSJ Team to Offer In-#Flight Access to Journal ... - Nassau News Live http://t.co/7E5bxwG16t
@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@SouthwestAir What is the best credit card to use/open to get miles with y'all?
@USAirways : i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt
@USAirways stuck in cae need reFlight Booking Problems for next flight possibly dm for more info
@USAirways thanks
@VirginAmerica will you be making BOS&gt;LAS non stop permanently anytime soon?
@SouthwestAir @saianel You could have just said "We don't know"
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
@SouthwestAir ...and how does one obtain this companion pass?
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
@united is hiring - Flight Dispatcher - Chicago, IL (Network Operations Centerl) https://t.co/lio6oCpTEQ
@SouthwestAir looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone's itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight http://t.co/BApE6RuMNE
Despite Mother Nature's best efforts, @SouthwestAir's good-humored folks got us home safely in an area heavily affected by winter storms.
@USAirways flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed
@AmericanAir flight AA1119, cx to AA157. Killing my layover, still wanting breakfast. I'm hungry! Get me to DFW!
@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
@USAirways 2 hours?! And just got disconnected.
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
@USAirways thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!!
@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
@SouthwestAir F5R3ZZ
@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont…
@AmericanAir do you offer group pricing discounts by any chance?
@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
@AmericanAir it's always nice coming home but I wish you'd fly LAX-MAD and keep me away from Iberia 😜✈️ #GoingForGreat
@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@SouthwestAir currently rebooked thru Dallas but I hear they are expecting an ice storm (sigh) #strandedNYC
@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX.
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...
@united past
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies.
@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
@VirginAmerica @AmericanAir can u help with flights to get a 2y old battling cancer who needs treatment in 🇺🇸 @FreyaBevan_Fund 💗 🎀 💗
@united How much is baggage check for International flights?
@SouthwestAir  is there a route to flight from Mexico City to Chicago midway using your services?
@AmericanAir DMing you now! Big thanks.
@SouthwestAir discount for three delays?
@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@united I would never fly United Airlines again!
@SouthwestAir my flight is Cancelled Flightled due to weather. What next ?
@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
@AmericanAir no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!! #sna2ord #1644
@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@SouthwestAir great example of customer service this morning at MSY headed to ATL. Alison and Bobbi were fantastic! Gate B8. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I would die if I got tickets to #DestinationDragons and you would be invited to my funeral
@SouthwestAir 2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?
@VirginAmerica Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues
@SouthwestAir Times change, I guess. http://t.co/osox9h7fWY
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE.
Yes!! Thanks so much!!! 💜“@united: @whitterbug We see you spoke with our Reservations team and they've reinstated the flight. Thanks. ^EY”
@JetBlue marks 15th birthday with @Airbus #A320 painted in 'Blumanity' paint job http://t.co/9vTFM7kNad
@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl

@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@timbennettg3 @USAirways Cancelled Flightled 4532 sch departure 8:38 am, wasn't snowing yet and other flights were still leaving #Fail

@SouthwestAir @karajusto SWA is willing to follow up. FINALLY.
@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was meant to fly on Sat, you just made it Tues, I can't afford to stay in a hotel for another TWO nights!
@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.
@AmericanAir Glad to hear that there were no serious injuries in the minor crash @dfwairport this evening.
@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
@AmericanAir - Whoooo Hooooo just crossed 25,367!!! At my current pace I should reach 152,202 for the year.
@united I have already emailed but I didn't know if it was more expedient to contact you here. Please advise. Thanks.
@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
@AmericanAir I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add’l fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
@USAirways But good luck getting there! Not cool.
@VirginAmerica any updates on flight 413 from Jfk &gt; Lax
@SouthwestAir #fail  southwest changes my flight to a different time and city and blames it on me. They won't correct it. #furious
@united thank you! 😊
@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
@JetBlue tried calling multiple times, i just wait and when it finally connects i get hung up on
@USAirways Please can someone contact me regarding my missing bag? It has been 3 days. Online tracking shows nothing.
@SouthwestAir Any plans to make the southwest app for Android not crappy?
@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
@SouthwestAir I tweeted several times last week about flight info during storm, always a timely tweet back.  Thx! 😄
@JetBlue plans to offer direct flights from #JFK to #DaytonaBeach, #Florida starting next #February.… http://t.co/oYLlRZQU5m
@AmericanAir is 2513 and 1555 on time or Cancelled Flightled?
@SouthwestAir I have a 5:30 flight out of Birmingham tomorrow night. Can I reschedule it for an earlier flight because of the expected snow?
@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
@USAirways - flight was Cancelled Flightled to Buf today. Waited in line for 2+ hrs &amp; cus service was rude. No flight until Tues. Need to get to ROC.

@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
@USAirways ...was Cancelled Flightled and now I need to locate my baggage
@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled.

@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
@USAirways it's vegas baby who doesn't have a good time in vegas lol
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
@JetBlue Thanks!
@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to "weather", while other flights were still landing at DFW
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
@USAirways flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer...

You know what ... RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/WJYAs2D94n”
@USAirways you keep suggesting people call 800-428-4322 but we just end up on hold for hours. You seriously don't have a better method?!
@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage
@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
@united flight delayed...again...every time. "Maintenance issues"
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly 😥
@JetBlue y'all got prices for the low??
@VirginAmerica Just bought tix for ATX - Dallas route - thanks for adding that! Love yr airline &amp; yr website is BEST transactional site EVER
@SouthwestAir Why doesn't mean TSA PreCheck show up on my mobile boarding pass? My KTN is linked to my account.
@JetBlue You guys need pillows on these rockers to really knock it out of the park ... just sayin ...
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
@USAirways 2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively?
@SouthwestAir flying by myself is getting old
@USAirways took me 4+ hours to book flights yesterday due to system errors between you and @AmericanAir. paid $320 extra due to time lapse
@USAirways My booked seat ended up being the last row which was labeled "do no occupy" had to play musical chairs for 30 mins. Unacceptable
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united
@USAirways - how do I get an answer to my question?  Holding for hours , after 6x getting your message just said you aren't taking calls.
@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320
@SouthwestAir who should I contact about a missing Rapid Rewards credit?
.@SouthwestAir received an error online and have been on hold for over 1.5 hours. Completely unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir my PR class would luv to know who's in charge of your Twitter. How many people write your tweets? #gracias
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
@JetBlue heading to Buffalo... trading the cold in Boston for colder in Buffalo... Maybe the Caribbean next time?
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
@SouthwestAir We invite to Fallow @HelacoHLC learn about our activities.Prevention Programs of Health by Condom-Rito Family.We R 501(C)(3)
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@JetBlue anything for you. #flyfi http://t.co/8jceDiKY9U
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
@JetBlue Thanks for the FB. message telling me I will have to wait between 1-3 days.  I'm waiting.
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
@united for our birthdays my fiancé &amp; I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
@united again HORRIBLE service, again attitude when asked for information, again you make me not want to fly UNITED ever. #platinummember
@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015
@JetBlue - loving Capt Joe on our flight from BOS to SFO #633. This should be fun!
@VirginAmerica Site down? #help
@VirginAmerica is your website ever coming back online?
@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@AmericanAir now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm
@USAirways over 2 hours and 14 minutes on hold and counting. Thanks for the help! #customerservice #brutal http://t.co/VsKXyAmnom
@SouthwestAir -17mph winds and would do anything to be in Florida right now.. help a sister out!!
@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
@SouthwestAir for my travel I see bz class and get away are sld out. Anytime is available . How do I know how many anytime are available?
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy...
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO
@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?
@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel
@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
@JetBlue Im just saying change can be amazing, like Miami. 😉
@JetBlue's CEO #pilots among ardent fans, Wall Street - Poughkeepsie Journal http://t.co/FRhuXiB8II
@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
@USAirways for a response in 3-4 days? No thanks
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am
I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united
@JetBlue sooo earlier i said i couldnt fly with you for my school trip but now i can! 😏
@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@VirginAmerica thanks so much for sharing. Just added it to my site http://t.co/TsviBTvT8h
@united crashed trying to check in.
@SouthwestAir I pay for a service to be delivered. Whether or not it is your fault shouldn't there be some sort of compensation?
@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@JetBlue If it was simply a minor mechanical, why would they say that?
@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)
@SouthwestAir @TheEllenShow @Imaginedragons if only that was me! 😍 #DestinationDragons
.@SouthwestAir  I finally hung up after 2 hours and was not able to get the flight I needed. #stuckintampa 😞
@USAirways how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status
@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@JetBlue @JayVig @roxydigital awww ^_^ R to the T, realtime appreciation from JetBlue #rockingthetweets #JVMChat
@AmericanAir Thanx for replying. DM sent
@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
@JetBlue if there is a "processing error" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest
@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is "On Request" now. Thanks.
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
@JetBlue When are you guys doing a dualcam with @RedReserve ?
@USAirways when I call it says y'all are too busy and to call back Late Flightr.  this is terrible customer service.  what will you do about it?
@SouthwestAir if I am enrolled in the ATL companion pass offer and booked 3 flights already before May 17 when can I start using the pass?
@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
@USAirways great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam
@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say "boo" not book. booo.
@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@AmericanAir about when can I see a new American Airlines credit card to replace my USAIRWAYS dividend MasterCard?
@SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑
@United to operated #B767-300ER from #Newark to #Zurich @ZRH_airport replacing B767-400ER between 6MAY-23SEP instead till 23OCT #avgeek
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
@USAirways I have a MAJOR complaint that I want to address w/you about my hand luggage courtesy check-in. What's the best way to do this?
@AmericanAir Thank you, but I'll be Cancelled Flighting my return flight, as I've already rebooked with another airline so I can get home today.
@SouthwestAir thanks!!
@USAirways I want to love you! 43 minutes on hold! Help me understand why I switched loyalty programs. http://t.co/cHGy5yrVka
@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
@SouthwestAir never mind, I moved my flight to tomorrow. Thanks for the help!
@United Bringing your "A" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY
@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
@united Blackmailed me into paying £130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@SouthwestAir my birthday is during #DestinationDragons and im a huge fan- anyway I can get tickets?
@USAirways @ClaudOakeshott don't need this link, after getting a person u now say u don't know where bags are. Lost on a nonstop phx to jfk.
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@SouthwestAir well I HAD a car &amp; free place 2 stay had I known Unacceptable treatment from Spvsr. Sally in Cleveland. #Disappointed
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude 😡😡
@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected
@JetBlue flight attendant Wendi on Flt 127 on 2/17, Newark to Orlando.  👍👍
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!
@SouthwestAir no worries. You're doing the best u can. Already Cancelled Flighted my biz trip. Still $LUV you! -RR 1079871763
@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!
@united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference.
@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?
@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr.
@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
@SouthwestAir is the best. Case and point. https://t.co/ucVnilMb4x @ryand2285 #HappyBirthday
@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
@VirginAmerica hi! i'm so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i've been trying 2 book since last week &amp; the page never loads. thx!
@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
@JetBlue thanks so I'll like to get the new tail N598JB N615JB Boston red Sox livery so I can share with talk but send them only on weekends
@SouthwestAir you guys held our flight #330!  Thank you!!!  About to take off from MDW now to Oakland.  Thanks
@JetBlue you're still the best
@JetBlue It's for me, I spoke with a rep on the phone who suggested I "Voice a concern" via "Email us" on your site. I did a few moments ago
@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.
@USAirways delayed in philly since 130, sitting onTarmac since 8pm flight 1881 plz contact donaldaroberts1@gmail.com
@AmericanAir please help us get home tomorrow!!!!!
@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@USAirways "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/0JJT4X3YxG
@SouthwestAir is main supporter of play where Jesus is portrayed as homosexual partner of Judas and who performs a “gay wedding” #boycott
@SouthwestAir $192 rndtrp 4/30-5/5 "@DJQ_KC: RT @djimpact: If you're trying to make travel reservations for Vegas on May 2nd it's too Late Flight"
@SouthwestAir how often are airplane seats/tray tables cleaned and sanitized? rather have air purifier and clean seats than #wifi 😷😱
@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
@VirginAmerica I’m looking forward to watching the Oscars on my flight home tomorrow. I might even get something bubbly to drink! ;)
@JetBlue planning on it!  Btw, excellent service and crew from DCA through SJU into SXM!!!!!
@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@AmericanAir yikes.
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
@AmericanAir AA2416 on time and awesome flight. Great job American!
@JetBlue I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue
.@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/b5ttno68xu” I just 🙈
@SouthwestAir Don't worry, you will! :-)
@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
@united ok thx!
@SouthwestAir is the vinyl part of the prize too?
@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!
@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service
@USAirways got off stand by list and on earlier flight to DCA. What is the status of my checked bag? Was supposed to be on #4047 thanks
Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole..
@SouthwestAir - Hi. My flight confirmation # is fwwe7f. We are currently stuck in Norfolk, Va. Trying to get to LGA in NYC. Ant updates? Thx
@AmericanAir Oh they seem  to have reappeared now lol
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@SouthwestAir -- any updates on flights getting Cancelled Flighted into DAL? I have a connecting flight there and hope it doesn't delay due to weather
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/XX5QSCjlL1” @BrandsSayingBae #Freberg15
@VirginAmerica Need to start flying to @KCIAirport .  😊😀😃😄
@JetBlue thanks for update http://t.co/K7uBOTMr1r
@USAirways 167 minutes?  "Im not trained in that". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
@JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs.
@SouthwestAir I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR tickets to the VEGAS... ANYTHING. I love imagine dragons so much!!
@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
@SouthwestAir Thanks for taking care of me Today!  Michele rocked the customer service! Gate 25 HOU
@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir can I get any kind of update on the delayed flight from Boston to Houston at 7:30? Really need to be back home tonight!
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!
@AmericanAir what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not?
@USAirways @AmericanAir me after arriving at 8:41am for a flight scheduled to depart at 8:57am. doors closed, no agents
@united Okay thank you
@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
@united flights taking off from IAD this afternoon?
Thank you @united for your prompt assistance.
@USAirways care to elaborate on why CHA to DCA is Cancelled Flightled this evening?
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@AmericanAir 2 months and still no exec platinum member cards. What gives?
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@SouthwestAir, thanks for being so good to us #military folk. It's cold in #StLouis but I sure enjoyed my flight. http://t.co/RcdH183Q1J
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@USAirways : Maybe You Should Drive #usairwaysfail
@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
@SouthwestAir any idea if there will be any "spring sales" soon for travel from Late Flight August to early September? Going from PA to LAX.
@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible "policies".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now.
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
@JetBlue What a great idea! #cometoAustin
@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!
@JetBlue, never been delayed before; 533 to TPA out of BDL. Better safe than sorry. 💙 #lovejetblue #onlyblue #jetblueforever
@united thank you so much. How will you be able to contact me?
@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30
@USAirways how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs...
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/M2wSg2olgo” -_-
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir I'm sure all these birds will be in warmer weather soon.
@USAirways still waiting on a response
@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!
@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
@SouthwestAir @dultch97 kid just wants fucking money #scumbag
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@AmericanAir please fix your inventory system, Plat upgraded then bumped DOWN after boarding, FA said they made a mistake. AA45 3A➡️8C 😕
@SouthwestAir I keep getting disconnected after choosing the option "unused travel funds" on your automated customer service line! SOS
@united thank you! My second flight I already got bumped up to 1st! Love it!
@JetBlue he loved the #natural #beefjerky snacks😉
@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
@AmericanAir I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@VirginAmerica Grand Budapest Hotel #OscarsCountdown
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
@JetBlue should I be nervous about a Sunday AM flight Baltimore to Boston? Any suggestions on what I can do? Need to be in Boston by Monday.
@SouthwestAir is there a resource to check delays/Cancelled Flightlations out of Love Field? Flying out tomorrow am and stressed about weather! ❄️
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
@JetBlue that's not a answer!
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
@SouthwestAir tried to rebook online but it says that I have to pay $200 for difference in price. Please help
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@JetBlue alright.
@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your "go to" maneuver?
@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! 👍
@USAirways why the hell u left *alliance and joined 1world is beyond me not a smart move time to start looking at other carriers
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
@USAirways No thank you. @AmericanAir was responsive &amp; I found alternate travel home.
@JetBlue Seems very likely.
@JetBlue It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)
@USAirways Good news, we got fixed.
@AmericanAir plane breaks, unloads the passengers, told to re enter to only come back off. Flight Cancelled Flightled, missed wedding. #badbusiness
@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@AmericanAir i was also told by agents my issues "aren't their prob" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!
@USAirways right on. Up. Up &amp; away ✈️🌞
@VirginAmerica New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think?
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH 😁
@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@USAirways that's why u guys are my #1 choice.
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@JetBlue If there's a schedule change on my tix, can you change the the destination airport to a sister airport (like EWR and JFK)?
@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to
@SouthwestAir are you guys gonna be giving away any tickets for @Imaginedragons at @VinylVegas? #DestinationDragons
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?
@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport "customer service line" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv
@SouthwestAir can you make a premium wifi that I can pay $30 for that is decent? #slow-fi
@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
@JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?
@united I can’t go back to the airport, I’m working, and won’t have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up
.@JetBlue this is enough for me to stop flying JetBlue.
@united doesn't purchasing ticket with a united card give me priority boarding ?
@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
@USAirways Charlotte Staff needs prayer....disappointed in response to mishaps ......lotttttttt of pissed off people here!!!!
@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
@united it most certainly was not.
@AmericanAir dmed back
@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?
@USAirways please thank Mellie at CAE, Tammy in baggage claim at CLT 4 #excellent customer service 2day, BUT I have a complaint.
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can’t be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
@AmericanAir now you're sending a gate agent to talk to us? Joke of an airline. Thanks for ruining my vacation. #neverflyAAagain
@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child.
@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
@USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards
@USAirways GF was on hold for 4 hours and call was dropped!!! HELP!!!!! Need a flight!!!
@AmericanAir - gold elite loyalty customer..can't count on my hometown preferred airline to do right. #bummed..
@VirginAmerica just promoting the product is all, had a problem with southwest and recommend noneother than the best! http://t.co/tFaNXBh1Cf
@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
@USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us
@united @perfectomobile Definately not an award for employer of the year #united13
@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@SouthwestAir Flight 3744 (N284WN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @PHXSkyHarbor http://t.co/Bd5tvr3Gcy
@JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats
@JetBlue I ❤️ Jetblue but i was on flt 277 from fll to sfo. tke off was over 1 hr Late Flight, div to phx &amp; got in 2 hrs Late Flight. What will be done?
@SouthwestAir Thank You. We'll be in touch! #MoveAboutTheCountry
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.
@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???
@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?
@SouthwestAir not as sorry as I was when I sat on a plane for 3 hours waiting for the engine to be fixed and THEN got my luggage lost, but k
@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed
@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.
@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@AmericanAir already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall
“@SouthwestAir: @kirkwoodtiger Hmmm... how does the Caribbean sound? https://t.co/AAY5avg99b ^LD” WARM THANKS!
@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.
@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
@JetBlue Can't view seat selection/change seat for flight tomorrow. Can you look into this?
@AmericanAir they did tell that our luggage stayed inside the plane ! Look this video http://t.co/YokkHHQcMP
@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
@USAirways @AmericanAir Not providing pilots for your flights: is this a new feature of your merger? #efficencies
@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
@AmericanAir can you help me update a birthday that was incorrectly input in a reservation? This is preventing me from checking in
@JetBlue A month ago I had a flight booked but then had to Cancelled Flight it... I'm now Flight Booking Problems a separate flight for a different occasion.
@SouthwestAir Service rep didn't say I was dumb just had the tone of voice like I should have known about it.
@SouthwestAir or you could send me a DM.
@AmericanAir um. down south has snow too #ATL
@AmericanAir - answer the phones.  Trying to change a reservation and haven't been able to get a human to pick up in two days.
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@united Cool. Thank you.
@USAirways forgot to call in the copilot so we're stuck on the plane in PHL. Looking fwd to being stranded in CLT. Day 2 of flight fails.
@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@SouthwestAir I'm Flight Booking Problems a flight to Vegas. Any good promo codes??
@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!
@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?
@AmericanAir my flight 1337 is Cancelled Flightled.  Can you let me know what my new flight info is?
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@USAirways @AmericanAir my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers…any help please?
@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :(
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@AmericanAir really American Airlines , service is Las Vegas is shocking, absolute jokers take your reputation more seriously!
@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to "fix" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane
@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@united remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see
@VirginAmerica had to change to another airline to get to DC today ... Why is @united able to land in DC but not you? Cost me $800 ...ugh
@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@SouthwestAir can you tell me if flight 805 from MDW-FLL tomorrow (2/24) is at full capacity?  i'm hoping for a little bit of extra room! 😊
@AmericanAir it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
@SouthwestAir you are lucky to have people like Annamarie and Norris at BWI. I hope they get recognized for excellent cust. service
@SouthwestAir Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together.
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@USAirways passengers sitting on plane for two hours flight #4663 from CMH!!!  All other flights have left #usairwaysfail #worstairlineever
@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
@AmericanAir I waited on hold for two hours, only to have my call. Really unreliable.
@SouthwestAir Could you maybe hook (@FuyukaiDesuYo ) with some imagine dragon tickets tonight! SHES a HUGEEEEE FAN &amp; would really love to go
@usairways &amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
@United just played the Most bizarre "safety" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl
@united I got it now. Wouldn't let me log on with my email. Thx. Here's hoping for dtw-ase without issue today
@SouthwestAir reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list?
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@JetBlue don't just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. .
@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
@SouthwestAir A wonderfully nice agent in Austin helped us out. Wish I remembered her name to give proper kudos.
@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@SouthwestAir All pieces were found and safely delivered to our home this afternoon.
@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@JetBlue yes! Always a treat to fly with you guys! 😊✈️
@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
@USAirways thank you!!!
@JetBlue flight from DCA to BOS has no heat #OhNo #BundleUp #Leastthebeverageswillbecold
@SouthwestAir I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@USAirways but i bougth mc caren to jfk with same agency and delta airways . Delta refund money but usairways doesnt accept to refund
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@USAirways Southern Hospitality luggage delivery service from SAV is AWFUL. Great @ delivering empty promises but not luggage #8hrs&amp;waiting
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
Sigh... “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W5NL0AY9Bl”
@USAirways No kidding. Oy.
@SouthwestAir No monkey business we luv SWA!! #mdw2mci #homeandreadyfornexttrip http://t.co/2xJvUn66ZZ
@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
@AmericanAir Still waiting on bags from flight 1613/2440 yesterday  First Class passenger not happy with your service.
@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@VirginAmerica I love your guy's song! We're dancing to it for our high school dance revue
@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
@JetBlue why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?
@AmericanAir v nice of you to give me a breakfast voucher for $7 in an airport. That almost got me a whole drink!!
@JetBlue I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a
@USAirways you guys straight up suck ass
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
@SouthwestAir first time flyer, scheduled a (round)trip. set on departure date not sure on returning date, policy/fees on changing Re Flight
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@USAirways chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@SouthwestAir had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business
@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
@united I've got a campus visit in an hour and I'm still wearing the same clothes...
@JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It's just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won't keep us away #lovejetblue
@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...
@USAirways After today,no reason 4 anyone to not approve merger with @AmericanAir,other airlines have no reason to fear losing business to U
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
@JetBlue Jua at JFK 'Just Ask' desk was incredibly helpful! Thanks!
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@JetBlue Need to get my 3-yr-old to Nassau (from SEA) to meet her great-granny she was named after - who just turned 103. #FlyingitForward
@united - ok noted. All details will be DM'ed to you shortly.
@JetBlue ready to go to Disneyworld!  For the @runDisney #PrincessHalf http://t.co/sTQY9V8256
@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well
@USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience.
@SouthwestAir snapchat, iMessage, instagram......
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
@JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security
@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems.
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
@united @SCVPools Please call me at 310-795-2210.
👉🚪RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dSDEbodmEL
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@JetBlue if my flight says delayed with estimated departure listed, can I arrive at airport Late Flightr?
@VirginAmerica Random Q: what's the distribution of elevate avatars? I bet that kitty has a disproportionate share http://t.co/APtZpuROp4
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
@JetBlue Gary who is serving us at FLL airport counter is really TRUE BLUE! Makes me feel at home even when a JetBlue flight is delayedl
@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@USAirways we are boarding now but have yet to depart.  Thanks for the response.
@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
@SouthwestAir thanks for taking such good care of my luggage... http://t.co/PIvxean3jY
@JetBlue they miraculously fixed the plane #kudos to shoe ever it was
@VirginAmerica I mean. Probably inappropriate while on board.. But, it's on!
@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
@JetBlue Oh no! I thought it did. :(
@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
“@united: @Addair  We hope you don't miss your connection. For help with re-Flight Booking Problems please Follow us &amp; DM your confirmation. ^CP”done thx
@SouthwestAir we checked in right at 24hr mark. Boarding C group with kids ages 6&amp;8 dnt want to be split. What sld we do?
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@SouthwestAir thank you for handling this for me. Glad Southwest cares about what it's flyers think!
@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
@JetBlue Promo Watch Phone $33 at Amazon check http://t.co/leNaOwFyvU
@united thanks, i made it.
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@USAirways trying to change flight because of airline travel advisory. on hold for 45 mins. Help!
@VirginAmerica , am I dreaming? Did you really just open up a route between Dallas and Austin?! And does this mean Houston might be next?
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
@JetBlue many thanks, as always your employees are professional and courteous. Whenever I have the option, you are my go-to airlines.
@SouthwestAir awesome. thank you!
@VirginAmerica Because we never rec'd Cancelled Flightlation notice we were left w no options to fly out of PS. Driving to LA for a red eye Mon w kids
@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac
@JetBlue okay thanks. Hope to be flying with you guys soon!
@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia

@JetBlue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks!
@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes
@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
@JetBlue basically stole my glasses, and now I can't drive or see in my classes and they're not answering my phone calls. #thanksJetBlue

@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there.
@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!

@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
@united leisure. Military personnel for safety reason R highly recommended to not travel in uniform
@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@SouthwestAir I'm on the 110 lol has anyone arrived yet??
@AmericanAir don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
@southwestair *any site*?   gmail, facebook, etc.
@SouthwestAir luckily, the people working the BSO at Chicago Midway have been very attentive and found our bags in Punta Cana.
@JetBlue Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!

@usairways #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! http://t.co/UPp41AbxrQ
@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
@USAirways so upset with customer service. I have a simple question and the phone system has disconnected me all day today and yesterday.
@united how else would I know it was denied?
@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks

@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.
@JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
@united hey, I missed my outbound flight - can I still use my return ticket?
@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines
@VirginAmerica it was amazing, and arrived an hour early. You're too good to me.
@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is "I don't really know what happened"
@USAirways what do I push to rebook with that 800 number
@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@JetBlue thanks so much. Can't wait to fly with you guys :)
@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards
@USAirways despite mechanical issues and many delays followed by a Cancelled Flightlation, still getting to Vegas thanks to great gate agents!
@SouthwestAir @NotPghTimothy no exceptions for national awards?
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for an hour &amp; a half trying to change my flight to BNA. Not very happy with customer service right now!!!!!!
@AmericanAir your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we're left stranded
@SouthwestAir The Fact That U See Black History Month 12 Months A Year Is Honorable! We WILL BE An Economic Base For Corp. Like U In Future!
@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying " delays happen".. Uh huh..
@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting
@USAirways I have received two reservation check-ins for two different flights for my one flight tomorrow morning. Need assistance ASAP
I always look forward to JB RT @JetBlue: @bostongarden :) Looking forward to welcoming you onboard! 💙
@VirginAmerica Are there any sign up bonuses to enroll in Elevate?
@JetBlue don't I always?
@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
@AmericanAir Can't unload flight #3322 because jetway is broken.  #steps #planB? #waiting nearly an hour
@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is "maybe your bag will come today. We don't know." Website says "status unknown"- can you help?
@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would "sit awhile" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.
@USAirways thanks for getting us on ur plane. Awesome flight attendant who is making us smile after difficult travel. #customerservice
@VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!
@JetBlue And we are glad to see what is going on and fix! @ProfessorpaUL15: please DM me your confirmation # so we can check.
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@USAirways Can you guys please give an update?  Been sitting on Tarmac on flight 601 yet the website still says it's on time?
@USAirways flt last nght Cancelled Flighted-mech.probs, flt this am Cancelled Flighted-snow, finally on a flt home. 1st cls empty &amp; they won't let me sit there
@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
@SouthwestAir especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper
@AmericanAir More or less - after a night in a party hotel - no sleep and a 5:30 am rebook- on our way back to PHL http://t.co/4G0K0z2rei
@AmericanAir stiiiil waiting. Please respond as my flight leaves in 2 1/2 hrs
@USAirways 2nd February in a row- stranded us when we try to return from Cancun! No contact info- no way to rebook! #badcustomerservice
“@AmericanAir: @TilleyMonsta George, that doesn't look good. Please follow this link to start the refund process: http://t.co/4gr39s91Dl”😂
@SouthwestAir yeah bruh its bool y'all niggaz just need to hire some more workers or something cause next time imma be forced ta disrespect.
@JetBlue nope. The "regular" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS.
@SouthwestAir I have a flight to Vegas coming up soon, but haven’t received any drink tickets Late Flightly. Can you help me out?
@united provide a voucher for one of my customers and I will tweet about you all day long #earnedmybusiness
@united Thank you! Have a nice evening.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love SW forever😃💕😍⤴⤴
@SouthwestAir it says I can't because my flight is in progress.
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@JetBlue I appreciate the speedy response. But the longer you delay the more inconvenience you put on your customers. Please nix change fee!
@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection 😡
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying "what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving
@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
@SouthwestAir you have open seats on flight 4001 pvd to MCO @ 1215pm today?
@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
@VirginAmerica just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome
@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!
@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE.
@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?
@SouthwestAir This is unbelievable... Thank you so much! #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.
@SouthwestAir thanks so much for making my night 😀 cannot wait for my trip next week! http://t.co/NbZ45jCd1r
@AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and...
@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers
@united where is our luggage
@JetBlue are we scheduled to depart as scheduled?
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
@AmericanAir I hear #Delta is offering 2,500 miles to frequent flyers if their bags doesn't come out within 20 minutes of landing thoughts?
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@VirginAmerica help. I was On  Flight  27 from JKF tonight. seat 7C left portfolio. Need it back!!
@JetBlue busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether
@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f
Do less please @JetBlue
@united @UnitedFlyerHD @United_Airline N26902 Dreamliner leaves London Heathrow. @B787fans http://t.co/aI0Yzwt8Za
@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?
@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@USAirways #555PHLtoSLC this is happening now.
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@USAirways question, friend flight got Cancelled Flightled. How can he book be flight? Leaving CHS to Philly to Germany
@AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta
@USAirways pullin some sh** delaying flights again... Smh @OBJ_3 http://t.co/Av2rfFHMcV
@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
@SouthwestAir Thanks. 436. Only a minor delay so not a big deal. :)Appreciate the concern though. Boarding now. You do have amazing service!
@SouthwestAir Great, thank you. Best of luck dealing with this horrible winter.
@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail
@JetBlue after my second call to customer service and the fifth person I talked to, an amazing rep fixed it in about 5 mins! :) #persistence
@AmericanAir any idea what's up with flight AA3181?
Cool thx! Only a couple more #PGAShow flights til I'm #Mosaic...can't wait. Will be easier to change flights when weathers bad@JetBlue
@JetBlue you guys continue to impress. Your crew @ MCO gate 4helped our family with seat issues. #professional
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@USAirways Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@SouthwestAir Already rebooked for tomorrow. Fingers crossed!
@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
@USAirways Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways
@USAirways Your Baggage system has hung up on me twice because you have too many callers. I NEED TO FIND MY HUSBAND'S (@SweetingR) BAGS.
@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@SouthwestAir Left my computer on the plane. Two weeks Late Flightr they found it and sent it to me. #greatservice.  #happy #customer
@JetBlue is it your standard protocol to call security onto a plane for a crying baby?
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@AmericanAir get me outta here
@SouthwestAir - STL-BOS flight today was Cancelled Flightled. Online resched form gives an error. On hold for past 90 min. HELP! #terribleservice
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@AmericanAir Love the new planes for the JFK-LAX run.  Maybe one day I will be on one where the amenities all function.  #NoCharge #Ever
@united "federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag"...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up…
@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love...
@USAirways please hold 3923! I can see it. Just can't get off my first plane quick enough
@SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :(
@SouthwestAir thanks for the reply, something is off with the phones becuz after 2 dropped calls at 2 hours on hold, I got through on 1 ring
@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
.@united You may "dislike delays" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time.
@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another "go-to" airliner
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@JetBlue why yes, yes it does!!!!  Great trip down!! Thanks for the lift!!!!
@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@SouthwestAir i hope i can be apart of the team with this job opening!
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@United I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight
@AmericanAir first ride on new 737-800 with new interior and in seat video. Nice improvement! #Newplanesmell http://t.co/dJJjN9sLHT
@AmericanAir @manuel_c "here for you" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or....
@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline
@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
@united No problem just follow me back so I can! Thank you!
@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
@SouthwestAir oh my gosh! Going to dm you now! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir been on hold to rebook a flight to CMH for 1.5 hrs. Your rebook website is crashed.
@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
@VirginAmerica For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would &lt;3 a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@SouthwestAir Customer service said it was a known problem that they were using same confirmation numbers for domestic and international
@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM
@USAirways I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight?
@USAirways can you please help me find my luggage since you're the one who lost it? Your customer service SUCKS.
@AmericanAir I understand you are busy but I have still gotten no answer. I need to get home and you guys have not helped at all
@SouthwestAir thanks for losing my luggage
@USAirways worst experience ever!!!!
@USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797
@SouthwestAir thanks for the quick response. Should I call daily it wait the 5 days.
@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@united final destination was booked through United but with quantas. United has not yet contacted Auckland. I am unaware of case ID number
@usairways on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE
@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.
@VirginAmerica @shrinerack Seattle bound. Wifey got me the duffle for vday. She's a keeper!!! Holla!!! http://t.co/JlOIbLnair
@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
@SouthwestAir Yes. I figured an hour was a long enough time to hold before giving up. Can somebody call me?
@JetBlue can your people working this contact me, I have a project in the works.
@SouthwestAir I start a new job tomorrow &amp; you Cancelled Flight my flight (1629 BWI-LAX) and you really can't get me on another flight today ?!
@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful.
@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of "pilots haven't arrived yet" announcements.
@USAirways I thought about moving a lot of business over too, but first impressions count.. Glad it was miles and not cash.
@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day.
@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@AmericanAir fl 249 to DFW is leaving Newark on time but is going to Nashville first.  Will I get stuck in Nashville?
@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs
@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?
@united UA1469. Just landed.
@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
@united - any way to get a message to an international flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
@SouthwestAir great flight! And great view! http://t.co/auFM4xdaj2
@AmericanAir Not necessary.  I am confident the excellent in-flight staff will make the appropriate report.
@JetBlue gr8 #Mint crew on #flight 123 to #LAX they're #Mintalicious #TrueBlueLove #ShelleyandMarcRock #travel #air
@USAirways I’ve been on hold for 36 minutes now, any time you want to answer the phone that would be great.
@SouthwestAir yep after two hours and thirty minutes
@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated.
@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow
@AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on
@united is the worst
@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
@JetBlue and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off?
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for over an hour and counting…just need a simple name change http://t.co/5Siczx1oez
@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
@AmericanAir #oaaret is our flight Cancelled Flightled?
@united in the process of purchasing ticket, when prices changed. unbelievable. #RipOffs #PriceDiscrimination
@JetBlue yep it's for tomorrow.
@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!💺✈️ Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
@USAirways thanks for a subpar travel experience and it's not even over yet #stepitup
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?
@SouthwestAir got it taken care of! thank you &lt;3
@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@JetBlue she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎
@USAirways That's 1h 10m waiting to get my bag, 1h40m of flight delays, plus the 2hrs of delay I had on the way out. Never flying you again.
@SouthwestAir adds new direct flights from #Columbus to Oakland &amp; Boston starting August 2015 #cmh #oak #bos
@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@JetBlue thank you for being jetblue and not jetgreen or jetred. blue is my favorite color! and jet blue makes it better :)
@SouthwestAir tv stream means I get to spend my flight watching 1999 and 2011 Women's World Cup Finals. #throwback #bestflightever
@SouthwestAir Arkansas Gov. plans to sign Governor SB-202 that legalizes discrimination of LGBT.Can you lend your voice to a state boycott?
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@JetBlue I'd go back to Haiti to deliver shoes, books&amp;medicine to kids I met in orphanage last year. #flyingitforward http://t.co/pGoeUXnsPI
@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.
@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
@JetBlue can't book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in "Verified by Visa" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw
@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?
@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
@USAirways got transf. to Dividend Miles...need to change flight.  Grandma just passed, need to change ticket ASAP. Update on wait time?
@JetBlue don't know if u define that as a #ControllableIrregularity
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@USAirways you guys have to be the worst. We are flying into Philadelphia and have only two jetways available for an on time plane.#pisspoor
@USAirways keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are "too busy" #idontwanttocallback
@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
.@SouthwestAir you've got a mess here at DTW but your staff is doing great.
@united is z and d code airfare refundable?
@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@AmericanAir flight was Cancelled Flightled can you guys help?
@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
Thanks. “@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We're sorry for the delay to your flight.”
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have "grounded" me today #painandsuffering
@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir try this. DPDFPP
@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
@JetBlue Haha. Thanks. You guys are great. Unlike the @nyjets. ;-) #GoPatriots!
@USAirways your airline also delayed our bags to us for 4 hours &amp; refused to ship them to our local airport #disappointed #stillbagless
@JetBlue thank you. Is there a possibility it will change?
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for points from RR Shopping to post to my account? Got email saying I've earned points but don't see em
@USAirways there is a travel advis for nyc and phil PA  -winter weather- but U.S. Air hasn't posted one yet. Can I still change flt wo pen?
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous "I dunno what time you will leave today. ". Dunno?! That's code for ...?
@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags
@SouthwestAir    How's life @ the NOC?
@USAirways @AmericanAir  stranded in North Carolina and trying to figure out options but can't get anyone to talk to
@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
@AmericanAir Flight 236 was great. Fantastic cabin crew. A+ landing. #thankyou #JFK http://t.co/dRW08djHAI
@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks.
@JetBlue thanks!! Great service in #T5 already! #lovejetBlue
@USAirways - My guess is what happened in #Vegas ended up in #Philly #Sexy http://t.co/qgMfCB7yT4
@JetBlue I did. They said not as of now. Let's cross fingers it happens before departing
@SouthwestAir @matthewebel And this is why I love flying Southwest. Excellent service, and you don't take yourselves too seriously!
@JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75
@AmericanAir My boyfriend was supposed to be home Saturday but his flight from DC was Cancelled Flightled yet again. Please get him home!
@JetBlue Wish Everyone felt like you
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@JetBlue ok. I'll book JB to JFK then book to ATH. Thank you.
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
@USAirways No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail
@USAirways luggage and contents destroyed both on outbound trip last week&amp;inbound lastnight in philadelphia #Careless
@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
@united U BUMS HOW DO U LOSE THE BIGGEST BAG ON THE FLIGHT
@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
@JetBlue the you above all commercials? Like the legroom one
@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
@SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag
@JetBlue Love you, bae. #JetBae
@JetBlue No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked.
@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience
@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
@southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID
@united clicked "upgrade now" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59
@USAirways Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing
@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,
@united I have.
@AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
@united you too!
@USAirways tell the flight from clt to srq 5080 to wait!!!!!!
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
@AmericanAir @united getting us to where we need to be. This is not acceptable. Not to mention, Cancelled Flighting meetings/interviews for my client
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@SouthwestAir thank you :)
@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!
@SouthwestAir  thanks Southwest for saving our trip. my sweetheart isn't going to miss seeing #AltonBrownLive thanks to y'all! #SOhappy
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!
@JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
@USAirways can I check bags through to my final destination even though I bought separate tickets from IAD to PHL  and PHL to Israel?
@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC.
@united DM sent
@SouthwestAir sent
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
@JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me!
@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
@USAirways If I know I left something on my last flight (as I literally had to run to make my connection), how can I retrieve it please?
@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! 🙌 #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
@USAirways Look into better service.
Oh wow. #sm “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/l0i8fnz3KU”
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood All were entertaining
@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.
@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.
@SouthwestAir your employees were great!
@united yes was trying to upgrade my seat. Now there are no available spots
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
@JetBlue Fliers to Gain Access to WSJ Content - Analyst Blog - Nasdaq http://t.co/dWEse7Xidr
@united stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail.
@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
@VirginAmerica Now, when will we see VirginAmerica come to Philadelphia (PHL).
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
@united 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy
@united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@JetBlue my mom always said to never settle. If your chips ain't blue, you just won't do.
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
@SouthwestAir we desparately need yall to make a nonstop BNA-&gt; TUL! Cmon it'll be popular. 😄 (right, @annebevi @PaulBev1  @MikeAbramson??)
@JetBlue We already won the tickets but she's totally on a beach right now. #flightlanding #sunscreen #feelsgood http://t.co/5PvG2hJXKp
@usairways It was 9º, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|
@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@AmericanAir im still on hold...
@SouthwestAir when will airfare be available through December of this year? I have 2 major trips coming up and I'm anxious to book them!
@JetBlue Tell me more 😳...Because I need a 1 way to NYC, and I might choose you
@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay
@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outraged😡😡
Stop this madness RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/7x9uSbj2FV
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg
@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool
@JetBlue Yeah I have! I'm on it!! Looking for specific dates - I will just keep checking daily for a fare drop
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@AmericanAir My chariot tonight. From this angle it looks like a 787, no? http://t.co/3ZZKQWWbJz
@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
@SouthwestAir Is there anyway to pay more to get priority boarding A 1-15?
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
“@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP” THANK YOU!  United Cares!
@VirginAmerica gives positive outlook, but sees increased competition - @Reuters http://t.co/jEu7Od3eYJ
@united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
“@JetBlue: @Ruth_Slobodin Why not? We'd sure love to see you, Ruth! #JustDoIt #YouKnowYouWantTo ;)” you know me too well 💘
@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@JetBlue flight 1183 to Orlando.
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(I look forward to that do much!
@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
@SouthwestAir @SacIntlAirport Feels like a good day to fly!!  Thanks for the ontime departure to SNA!!:) #bestinclass #30000ft #takemehome

@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?
@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
@SouthwestAir @intuit @jhamilton2007 4 moms, 4 careers, 1 day trip to LA. #intuitlife #leanin http://t.co/2qJbCv5jzq" #southwestairlines
@JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@SouthwestAir my birthday is February 24th which is the date of the imagine dragons in flight concert btw
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS
@VirginAmerica @madbee95 check the website before you go to the airport!
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
@SouthwestAir Why do you have to be 18 😭
@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
@JetBlue FYI, I'm onboard #616 comfortably travelling to JFK, seat was no problem as you said. Thanks for making flying more civilized!
@SouthwestAir Hi do you know why WN4287 is already delayed until 9:35pm tonight? Thanks !
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/TnKIXXrxHB” 😂😂
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@USAirways don't think you guys could mess things up any more.. Never flying with you again!
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
@AmericanAir any delays on tonight's flight from DFW to SAT? I have family members on board.
@USAirways any travel advisory coming for the Carolinas?  Bad weather!
@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
@JetBlue 👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
@AmericanAir we are waiting flight 919 !We are at JFK for about 24h !! #NewYork #919 #viracopos #AmericanAirlines http://t.co/3FheS0lPMU
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@SouthwestAir props to your LAS employees working C11 gate. Because of them I am not opposed to flying through or to LAS in the future! 👏👏👏
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
@SouthwestAir looks like you are up and running for the day. Still can't get through on the phone. Can you follow so I can dm you my info
@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there
@USAirways I was on hold for 2 hours and still no answer. Is this really how you run your business? http://t.co/P8xFhq4kps
@USAirways 5 hours on the phone waiting for a call back to find my luggage #shameonyou
@SouthwestAir disappointed with customer service right now, my flight was only one Cancelled Flightled at my airport &amp; now I'm losing 2 days from trip
@JetBlue thanks. I appreciate your prompt response.
@JetBlue do they have to depart from Washington, D.C.??
@SouthwestAir Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :(
@JetBlue so I don't know confirmation number or the names of the flight attendants and supervisor
@SouthwestAir #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather
@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have "planned better."
@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
@USAirways if one with @AmericanAir why can't you use American miles????
@JetBlue 2:55 tomorrow from RIC to BOS. Looking good or am I better rescheduling?
@AmericanAir is that the flight for tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for two hours and finally hung up. I was able to do what I needed to without customer service eventually.
@AmericanAir if I've booked an AA award on USAir metal, and space opens up on AA metal, can I change to the AA flight without fees?
@AmericanAir Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because "no weather advisory."Really!
@SouthwestAir ohk. Thank You!!! B/C of the inexpensive airfares that Southwest has I can now travel around.
@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
@JetBlue @CinziannaP thank you! I like the quick response on Twitter!
@VirginAmerica "You down with RNP?" "Yeah you know me!"
@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off.
@SouthwestAir https://t.co/OQUKSo3s2O subscribe please https://t.co/OQUKSo3s2O
@united Thanks Yup I'm all set.  It happens.   SLC ground staff were prompt,  helpful and courteous.
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
His name is Enzo 😊 RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg
@SouthwestAir Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day#annoyed
@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/fW3cy8HGdJ
@USAirways Thank you.
@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
@AmericanAir Trying for 20 hrs to reach agent. Must make change that can't be done on web by 11:59 PST. Had to Cancelled Flight revs ystday.
@JetBlue Awesome, thanks! I'll give a call Late Flightr today. Appreciate the help!
@USAirways was on hold for four hours, never got connected. Came to the airport and your rep essentially told me and everyone else to screw
@SouthwestAir they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight?
@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!
@JetBlue Thanks. Which day of the week is the direct?  The flights I saw went thru JFK   ☀️
@JetBlue any concern about Cancelled Flightled flights due to the cold weather in NJ Saturday am? Do you Cancelled Flight at 0 degrees?
@SouthwestAir just added #passbook support to their iOS application! Finally, I get to add them to my collection. http://t.co/lEdNoCdQee
@AmericanAir Thank you
@JetBlue What about if I booked it through Orbitz? My email is correct, but there's a middle party.
Happy #TT to my friends @AmericanAir . Hope the weather isn't causing you too many headaches.
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise
@united your airline is a joke. 1 person working special services at EWR?!? Line is 15 ppl deep. GROW UP!
@SouthwestAir sure. Fhk2te. Am scheduled to leave this weekend but need to push to October
Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids, need to be certain. Thx

@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
@JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
@SouthwestAir MAC computer left on BWI to LA flight on 14th.  Reward for recovery; info important to owner.#HELP #passengers #honesty
@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
@JetBlue We had 2 great flights into and out of the Bahamas, even during the bad weather in the northeast, thanks for the great service!!!

@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons
@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever.
@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection.
@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
@VirginAmerica partners with @Visa Checkout as mobile payment method to help boost mobile conversion rates #etailwest #payments #visa

@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@united I'm aware of the flight details, thanks. Three hours Late Flight a crew that could not give less of a shit
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
@JetBlue Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn't bring it on.
@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
@USAirways what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight?
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@united I appreciate the follow up.
@united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
@USAirways won't waive $200 fee due to #neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic #waivethefee
@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
@JetBlue she was a phone agent, pls do! Peggy was pleasant, informative and delivered. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
@USAirways u guys suck
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home.
Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir  flight to dca I need to change asap help can't get through
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened
@VirginAmerica Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :)
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
@JetBlue it was at JFK airport right now
@SouthwestAir Yes, but I like need my luggage before tomorrow morning
@USAirways @AmericanAir Thank you for a couple of easy, hassle free flights today, professional and friendly staff made everything easy!
@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you...
@SouthwestAir grouchy about this flight 636 #complimentarybeveragesneeded
@SouthwestAir just did, thank you
@SouthwestAir DM sent! Thanks so much for responding! Your response was so timely, I missed it!
@USAirways the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV
@AmericanAir yes I have. Thanks
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
@AmericanAir can I get home before 12 or no?
@AmericanAir can't get thru to anyone on phone
@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service.
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?
@JetBlue sis and 16 month old nephew are. Last nights flight and this am mega delayed. Now this evening's is starting w delays. Why?
@JetBlue I'd like to spread my grandpa's ashes in Naples, Italy he lived in the 50's while serving his 30+ yrs in the @USNavy #FlyItForward
@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@AmericanAir @macario2 but you are Late Flight again!! Again and again! Where are the crew?
@AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating
@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@SouthwestAir lemme come to #DestinationDragons 😭😭😭 this university student could use a break from all these books.
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@SouthwestAir wouldn't it be awesome for my first time flying to be #DestinationDragons?!
@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?
@JetBlue waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this?
@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@SouthwestAir I thank you for the reply but too complicated to DM, really would like to talk to a cust rep. What is going on there?
@AmericanAir Also Agent not aware clearly of http://t.co/FWKJ49B1LE
@SouthwestAir trying to rebook flight. On hold for 23 mins before disconnected and now almost 40 mins? Unbelievable. http://t.co/0BJNz4EIX5
@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
@SouthwestAir yes. Hung up and called a different number.
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy)
@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting.
@JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
@VirginAmerica best customer service rep in the world! #irmafromDallas takes the cake!!!
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out
@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh
@AmericanAir why won't u deliver my luggage? Almost two days and holding on the phone for over 4 hrs. Help!
@SouthwestAir when does today's scavenger hunt start? I'm trying to help my little brother win! #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir #stepup #makeitright re you best? Or just money hungry? #wewillsee
@SouthwestAir do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir we were rebooked on the 5:05 out of MDW.  Some drink coupons could help!
@SouthwestAir #RedCarpet Southwest Companion Pass would be great!
@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It’s a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
@SouthwestAir sending now via dm
@JetBlue sent
@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
@SouthwestAir Weather keeps slowing us down. Not your fault. This is the 1st time a Southwest flight of mine was Late Flight so I can't complain :)
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
@united Life goal: complete ✔️
@SouthwestAir is that @MurraySawChuck
@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: "Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online." #FUSTURATED
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
@JetBlue u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim
@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir Thank you for having flights going out of Nashville! You guys Rock! #DisneyPrincessHalfMarathon #girlsweekend #bffs
@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated.
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2
@JetBlue while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option
@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?
@USAirways congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too
@USAirways Haha - that will indeed be a great day!
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
@JetBlue i deleted that tweet because one of your wonderful employees swooped in to help--faith restored. You are one of the good ones. 👍
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@USAirways experience exceptional service from Cherry at #DenverAirport.  #GreatService. #professionalism
@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
@JetBlue Thanks for the complimentary upgrade to first.  You are the best!
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@SouthwestAir can u better define the "plus one smaller type" item on carry on requirements?.. small backpacks?
@AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn't a problem.
@JetBlue is giving us free movies because apparently the dunkin donuts coffee is a safety hazard. #thingsyoucantmakeup #switch2SBux?
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
@USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question
@JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) Update: @JetBlue says #Lufthansa ... - Markets Bureau http://t.co/aPY3zLSqUu
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@JetBlue lmfao.
@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?
@SouthwestAir wife's flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home?  1708 PHX-&gt;DAL
@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
@united DM'ed you
@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@SouthwestAir thank you kindly.
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemispheremagazine with out flying?
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/7br5t5QCXk (via @ParachuteGuy)
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@SouthwestAir 20 passengers on this plane. I should've just grabbed my baggage and gave it its own seat.
@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@SouthwestAir No I have not.
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir your hold music sounds like it's from Super Mario Bros for gameboy color
@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
@SouthwestAir same here. Would appreciate a follow so I can DM my info to figure out what I am supposed to do.
@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@SouthwestAir unfortunately I don't even have that. My phone died before o had a chance to grab it. It was from OMA to SAN from 3/27-4/2
@JetBlue Thank you for opening the conversation.  I hope you can make it right.
@AmericanAir r u serious?? 304min #delay with #AmericanAirlines #AA2444 #ohio - #dallas missed my connecting flight http://t.co/DNMsblzumr
@VirginAmerica Really? Sprint? I thought you guys were 'kewl'! 0_0
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
@USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@SouthwestAir Awesome - thanks!
@united Freakin"
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@JetBlue 2 words: "staff training." What a joke-
@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? 🙏
@SouthwestAir male flight attendant on flight 3913 from Orlando to Indy was AMAZING! He needs a raise 👍 Had the best experience with him
@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground &amp; somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
@SouthwestAir are passengers automatically rebooked on other flights if original is Cancelled Flighted for weather etc?
@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@AmericanAir two were non revs, right?
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
“@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.” Stop sending generic responses
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@united you are one great airline ❤️
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/pa7dCjXlzL”C'mon fam😭😭 just. No. Ok?
@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
@united I was just calling the Global Services help desk so via phone.
@United can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight?
@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
@USAirways any tips on getting a hotel that your airline won't get for any of us even though we were told that we'd make our flight?
@USAirways help im falling out of one of your planes
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@SouthwestAir what is the status of the bag check area at FFL?
@USAirways yes I can pay out of pocket that us not helping me for loosing my first class ticket to coach.   I want resolution or a comp
@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/7iM9rHIvyR” Plz stop
Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.
@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
@JetBlue so happy you can accommodate peanut/treenut allergies on flight! 1st online cover from air provider
@JetBlue did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@JetBlue really caring??
@SouthwestAir give me tickets to atlanta! I would do anything!  Anything 😆
@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes, all people is very nice, it's amazing! Can you please follow me back? 😋I love the company!
@JetBlue Says #Lufthansa Incentive Offer To Have No Impact On Share Count - Nasdaq http://t.co/VU7XSWJKiY
@USAirways will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :(
@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@USAirways CSTSVC in PHL honors UR system over my reality. No RCD of change in HPN. Now extra hours in PHL or $75 to get to CLE.
NO“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/UgFCKErmrW”
@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.
@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
@USAirways   my miles will expire on 2/29 and it could take someone 10 days to respond...I have over 150000 miles that I do not lose i❤usair
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@SouthwestAir Teyana Taylor Performing #MedusaFridays 2.27 Free Till11 http://t.co/qwFMoQ0dQl http://t.co/kbb0B5FxMK #TheMenOfBusiness
@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?
@SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. 😉 Can I tweet at the TSA??
@USAirways Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!
@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?
@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights..
@SouthwestAir oh no worries. Just have never seen that before until today. I mean…it is a great card 😀
@AmericanAir I can hardly believe it! Bundle up and stay warm! 😉
@united I have a question
@USAirways I'm flying with you this Summer. Will I be able to leave Miami Airport during my 12 hour stopover there?
@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?
@VirginAmerica does Virgin America fly direct from Seattle to NYC or Boston?
@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
Please explain …….. “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vOsIzh17sl”
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@AmericanAir keep up the good work.  Got me to my destination safe and on time today
@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@JetBlue nope. None to be found
@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted.
@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@VirginAmerica What is the reason  for the delay of the departure of VX 413 from JFK this afternoon?
@AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don't spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow
@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@united I see several economy plus can you put us in those. We don't have to be seated together
@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@JetBlue i'm getting info from the website, but needing to check it and the alerts would be much more beneficial.
@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made
@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
@SouthwestAir when will you have flights for October 2015 available?
@VirginAmerica love the 90s music blasting at gate in #Boston while waiting for flight to #SanFrancisco. Only if I could get an iced coffee!
@VirginAmerica morning. If I have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can I DM you?
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
@AmericanAir is rising like the sun at DCA this morning.  @NATCA members have the best view. #avgeek http://t.co/VAhdekVOKe
@united No thanks.  Took care of it when I called
@SouthwestAir WiFi on yesterday's flight extremely slow a waste of $8 and lost the travel time for work.
@united playing hide and seek with the gate. "We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
@SouthwestAir Hi I just got a message that part of my flights is Cancelled Flightled. I can't rebook online and nobody answers my phone call. Help me
@JetBlue offers free flights for "Fly it Forward" campaign http://t.co/Yh1KZkYZrR http://t.co/wmO6tKqhXp via @usatodaytravel #travel #cause
@VirginAmerica I’m having trouble adding this flight my wife booked to my Elevate account. Help? http://t.co/pX8hQOKS3R
@AmericanAir Let's all have a extraordinary week and make it a year to remember #GoingForGreat 2015 thanks so much American Airlines!!!
@VirginAmerica thank you for the easy itinerary shift for impending weather. Quick, painless &amp; free.
@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: "Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."
@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
@united aisle please
@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk
@USAirways delayed 2.5 hours @longbeachairport trying to get to @PHXSkyHarbor; give us an update, please???
@JetBlue can't wait! I'll be the one who can't contain herself. 😄
@SouthwestAir Have been on hold to reschedule a flight for 1.5 hours! Please help! Phone will be out of batteries soon.
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flighted because of #Neptune Could not get to my destination. #notmyfault  #waive$200fee #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer
@USAirways @HutchinsJim Yes, I made the flight and got my workout in too.
@JetBlue Thanks! Her flight leaves at 2 but she's arriving to the airport early. Wedding is in VT in Sept. Grateful you fly to BTV!! :)
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@SouthwestAir continues to prove to be the best airlines 💪
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@united thanks for reaching out. The seat was hard, not enough cushion. OK for short flight. BTW, UA6465 flight and crew were great!
@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?
@AmericanAir I can DM it to you, if you follow me
@SouthwestAir amazing service by your SW stewardesses! From den to Cun and from CUN to Atl and atl to lax. Thank u!
@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?
@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
@AmericanAir what terminal LHR for aa5/BA1506? Doesn't say in boarding pass
@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!
@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
@USAirways Round Two of being THE worst airline ever.
@AmericanAir wow that's helpful.
@SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect
@SouthwestAir No thanks. After those 25+ minutes someone did eventually help us and took care of it.
@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
@USAirways @TheHaileyTate Another blatant lie from @USAirways
@USAirways @AmericanAir you make Spirit look like the gem of air travel. You haven't handle this winter storm very well...
@AmericanAir Please follow me.
@JetBlue credit to you for replying.  I’ll look forward to hopefully one of those 103 on my flight home tonight :)
@USAirways still not in the air for deicing of plane. I'll miss connect but customer service was helpful.I'm hoping to catch the next flight
@jetblue We'd love to help Shanese Bryant-Melton, a hard-working grandmother from DC, go to Miami. It's on her bucket list. #flyitforward
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
@AmericanAir @ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago.
@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my Late Flight flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!
@USAirways #fail when the inbound flight arrives after the scheduled outbound departure, and still "on time" http://t.co/k0MHZrJF6e
@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional
@United so what’s the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@united #FirstClass to #London on my way to #LondonFashionWeek #LFW15 👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧👠🇬🇧
@united customer service what's That???
@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@southwestair y'all just Cancelled Flightled the flight i rebooked after 1st was Cancelled Flightled. help? I need to be in nyc. schedule more flights tomorrow!
@SouthwestAir I was helped by a nice lady at PHX checkin. I spent 4 hours on hold in 24 hours, so might want to look at efficiency there.
@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery
@USAirways done
@united DM the conf # to you - did you receive it?
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@SouthwestAir she's still stranded in DC. Sat until 3:30am with 100 other kids. They were starving, and exhausted.
@AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom
@SouthwestAir we are having a real issue trying to get thru to you.  On hold for 2 hours &amp; got disconnected!  Please help!
@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@JetBlue are you ever looking for interns ?
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.
@united I take it as a compliment that I was mistaken several times as a member of your staff on my flight... time to remove my scarf :)
@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!
@USAirways Going to Manchester, UK now i'm going to miss a wedding. You going to rebook that too? Why have you chosen to Cancelled Flight my flight??
@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a "courtesy report"
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier
@USAirways checked into my flight yesterday and have been bumped to a Tuesday flight! Unacceptable and no agents to speak to!
@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
@united all good, didn't die or anything. As they say "you get what you pay for"!
@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now
@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.
@JetBlue lol the fleet on fleek... i see yall ballin... new jets on deck..
@SouthwestAir Great #BlackHistoryMonth commercial! Thx! #ATL #singer #musician #life #BlackLivesMatter
@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
@USAirways 23 min on hold... Drove 2.5 hours to get my delayed bag. I just want to pick it up at SJU.
@VirginAmerica still waiting to see  @Starryeyes_Dev_  😞
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
@USAirways 25 mins after the scheduled departure and still sitting in terminal. Communication would be lovely... http://t.co/pkAxUNYfn2
@USAirways according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there?
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
@SouthwestAir thanks for the Cancelled Flightation today. Only airline that's Cancelled Flighted. Lost a customer today.
@USAirways waiting all day at ATL since flight this am Cancelled Flightled. 1 standby told no seats and group of 15 shows up Late Flight and gets on to PHL
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
@JetBlue thanks for letting us know. Hoping for no more delays!
@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond
@SouthwestAir your checkin system is #poor
@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed
@SouthwestAir Yeah, we figured it out.  Thanks.
@united. Thanks United for the no running water and Late Flight flight from Grand Rapids to Denver
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@USAirways has failed me all day long, should I blame it on @AmericanAir ?
@SouthwestAir DM Sent.
@SouthwestAir SWA helps the hotel industry. I always book flights a day before I need to be somewhere as SWA consistent Cancelled Flights/delays.
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?
@SouthwestAir I changed my flight through St. Louis. Thanks for the reply though!
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
@JetBlue I'm on flight and no booze being served 30 min in... What gives? #lostrevenue #angryandsober #bachelorpartymishap
@JetBlue Follow me pls?
@SouthwestAir Please bring back RDU to FLL direct route!  I noticed it is missing starting in Late Flight August!  The flights are always packed!
@USAirways can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco.
@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule...
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
@SouthwestAir All's well. I got comped with multiple other bags which just made my day! http://t.co/1AAVvoREpH
@united Club in Denver is dope 👌
@united Contacted yesterday and was told that there's nothing they can do - they suggested I email for some compensation ??? cust service???
@JetBlue @Cinnabon the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky
@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
@SouthwestAir think you have great people working for you.
@USAirways I saw online you had fee but I was wondering if there was a way to pay for it ahead of time, instead of at the kiosk
@SouthwestAir making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah
@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.
@SouthwestAir thank you for the response. How can I got about getting the points onto my rewards account?
@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this
@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@JetBlue as requested, here's selfie somewhere over the Rocky's. #milehighselfieclub http://t.co/A1ChOxKPJp
@united you guys suck!
@VirginAmerica How about some free drinks on the flight back for the free promo?
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I’ll ride US for life
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@SouthwestAir have to be honest, didn't expect a fast response, thank you!  Off to #Chiberia we go!
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member 😔
@JetBlue when are you guys flying it froward in the Bahamas.
@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An "aw, let me help" cld mk it btr
@AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
@JetBlue - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Sent a DM to you. Let me know if oyu need any additional information.
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@JetBlue Thanks! I just sent a few DMs.
@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@united OK, thanks for the clarification.
@AmericanAir shoutout to the agent on duty now @ Gate B1 #ABQ / outstanding customer service w delayed FLT 336 http://t.co/OoEJ4d4JoP
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
@SouthwestAir it was not - still don't know where skis are and cannot get a call back from bag svc at airport (left several msgs)
@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
@USAirways Flight US 723 from @DublinAirport to @PHLAirport passing over @LoveLoughNeagh at 20,000 ft this morning. http://t.co/FRd0cAy6DA
@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour
@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
@SouthwestAir my flight was delayed 4 hrs. I'm 5 months pregnant &amp; supposed to be caring for my mom whose in surgery now. Very upset.
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@USAirways #usairways Raleigh NC; baggage carousel staff were aggressive towards people waiting 1 1/2 hrs for bags. Flight 699
@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
@AmericanAir I saw it finally come through on the mobile app. However it's for tomorrow and I have meetings tonight that I'm trying to make.
@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
@SouthwestAir That was Chantilly, Paris, France.
@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
.@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover.
@AmericanAir @maryella_green despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!
@USAirways depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm.
@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever
@USAirways thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
@VirginAmerica @VirginAtlantic @GMA @AmericanAir Can You Help #ourprincess in need of some help in #USA 🎀🇬🇧🎀🇺🇸🎀 http://t.co/778AzTDaer
@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
@SouthwestAir #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I'm watching free TV it works but won't hardly access any websites - including your own.
@USAirways flight 705 FRA-CAT did some odd zig-zagging movements over Frankfurt...Is everything ok?
@USAirways sitting on a plane in Philadelphia for over 20 minutes waiting just to get off the plane. Great service!
@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
@JetBlue thank you for always have the most amazing customer service! Bring on The Disney Princess Half Marathon
@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?
@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@AmericanAir can you guys help me please?
@USAirways needs to get it together in Indy. Only 2 ticket agents and a line to the door. Felt bad for ppl who missed their flights.
@SouthwestAir is the contest over for Destination Dragons? I want to try to do everything I can to go.
@SouthwestAir followed.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tEjrN09tfw” NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
@SouthwestAir where are our bags?We have a tv show to film!!
@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  I'm Lady Gaga!!! She is amazing! 😊
@JetBlue  I'm game if you're buying!!  ;)
@SouthwestAir experiencing the worst customer service ever currently. Waited for CS rep, then put "on hold" but actually was hung up on.
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@JetBlue marks 15th birthday with 'Blumanity' paint job - @Dallas_News (blog) http://t.co/lFGR0Nifut
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@USAirways why did you Cancelled Flight flight 1773 to phl, while delta flew a flight at the same time, on time? you Cancelled Flighted for no reason
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn’t 1997!
@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
@USAirways UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn't #Cancelled Flighted
@AmericanAir You're right. Someone is up to something...
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for an hour now. 59:57 as I type this. Ridiculous! All I need is the link to the chart that has routes, time
@JetBlue They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago.
@AmericanAir Thanks for the champagne  AA153 ORD-NRT to celebrate my #TokyoMarathon2015 finish! http://t.co/Ij4xL01tKX
@USAirways really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher.
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@JetBlue i am here - what is your resolution?
@AmericanAir I tried to book a rwrd and was told I couldnt. Bought tix on USAir (now AA-no choice) didn't bother to + AAdv# with this svc...
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather✈️
@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same
@USAirways flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Any word on accommodations for the passengers on US 746 when they arrive in Charlotte? Lot of tired passengers here
@USAirways @usairways -Really? U land me in Philly 1.5 hours before my flight, wait 1.5 hours behind a plane you got stuck,
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons I tried. 😔 It's okay
@VirginAmerica @LadyGaga @CarrieUnderwood Sorry, Mary Martin had it first!
@USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. 👍

@SouthwestAir thanks for the follow up. So glad to get my bag back.
@USAirways I don't want a reservation change, just adding a service. Am going public with this to get help.
@united severely under staffed at Iah.
@JetBlue what's a good address to send feedback over email?
@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
@USAirways skys r sunny air is cold I can't wait to get to #CLT
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the vouchers after the long wait on the runway Saturday night at BWI! I really appreciate it! #SWfan
@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help
@SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@SouthwestAir it is working on a different device, though. Any help is appreciated.
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this.
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til "U" are the only "U" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks
@VirginAmerica @virginmedia I'm flying your #fabulous #Seductive skies again! U take all the #stress away from travel http://t.co/ahlXHhKiyn
@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed
@JetBlue spoken to 2 reps. Once I'm allowed to check my bag and through the TSA checkpoint, I guarantee I will be talking to someone.
@AmericanAir she has  the guy u served drinks 2  til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
@SouthwestAir to the rescue. Sundown in Chicago. Next stop San Antonio! http://t.co/rQBpmwETtq
@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@JetBlue shut up an turn on the tvs/music
@JetBlue @BrandsSayingBae well here we go
@SouthwestAir DeLacy P is a compassionate professional! Despite the flight challenges she made passengers feel like priorities!!🌟🌟
@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
@SouthwestAir filing it now. Thank you for your response.
@JetBlue thank you #loyalmosaicmember
@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues
@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
@USAirways can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
@VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows "{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || '0' | number}} Points", won't let me checkin
@AmericanAir Please explain why it costs almost the same price of a full roundtrip fair to only change the departure time of a flight?
@USAirways ok thanks
@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
@VirginAmerica thank you
@AmericanAir poor customer service is just unacceptable.. Also how bout the surfer on the front of your website. #noloveforsurfers #pretend
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
@AmericanAir gotta love those skycaps, solving problems faster than anyone else in the terminal. And they did it with a smile on their face
@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
@united too long for 140 characters
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss holy fuckinf shit
@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
This is so smart it makes me angry MT @JetBlue: We’ve partnered with @WSJ to bring you free digital access onboard! http://t.co/0LiwEcAsOe
@SouthwestAir Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There's zero non-stop in Aug and Sept
@JetBlue should i continue?
@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
@AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo
@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2)
@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
@AmericanAir. Had my flight changed from US Airways to you, now I can't get two seats together. Can you help?
@USAirways I'm referring to email like this.  Just tell people when they GET the upgrade. Otherwise, we know already. http://t.co/N8UvCLMADA
@SouthwestAir on hold now for 1 Hour 25 mins Whats the holdup
@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it
@united I would like 2 speak @United VP of #CustExp Jimmy Samartzis! I sent a survey/email about my awful flight exp http://t.co/OtFZ7CygUQ
@SouthwestAir Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a "kid" section (near the back) ;)
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@AmericanAir man we have been sitting in #UA4753 on the tarmac for 30 mins...rescue us please!
@USAirways been on hold for almost 2 hours trying to rebook my Cancelled Flighted flight. What in the world?!!!

@USAirways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn
@united with about 25 people trying to get on flights
@SouthwestAir could you tell me if any upgrades are available on a flight out of STL tomorrow morning.
@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
@USAirways Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
@JetBlue wow, keeping up with the times...
@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
@JetBlue Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere
@USAirways claimed my flight Cancelled Flighted because PHL runway not good but Delta flight at same exact time is taking off on time.
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@JetBlue Thanks. Used phone instead of computer and it worked!! Thx again!
@SouthwestAir trying to get anyone on phone. Flt Cancelled Flighted. Please get me to Denver.
@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but "unavailable"to book. False advertising much?
@SouthwestAir On flight 771 tomorrow (Wed 2/18) DEN-BNA. Will we be delayed or Cancelled Flightled?
*On the brink of bankruptcy. “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/01ldxn3QqQ”
@AmericanAir thanks.....
@SouthwestAir  Southwest is currently awaiting government approval for this route. Do we know when it will be official?
@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will turn 2 during the trip do I have to buy a return ticket for my child?
@JetBlue "Goodwill" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136
@united I am impressed with your super-fast reply to @CGJase
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now
@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir that luggage you forgot...#mia.....he just won an oscar😄💝💝💝
@USAirways first flight Cancelled Flightled, connecting flight delayed so will completely miss next connection no response on hold 2 hrs HELP me
@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m
@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed.
@SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
@united every time I search a flight your site logs me out and gives error message. About to book on a different airline and Cancelled Flight my card.
@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)
@united how about 3659 YUL-ORD?
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I’ve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y’all every time!
@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
I know you have a lot of baggage... But i want you to know i really enjoyed being inside you. @JetBlue #Jetbae
@SouthwestAir When does PV get approved? I am ready to go!!
@SouthwestAir have been doing that for hours already
@USAirways @rylietolbert15 wow you wouldn't say
@USAirways after missing my flight and reFlight Booking Problems 2x, I just walked onto another flight and my phone was still on the seat!!
@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue
@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while..
@AmericanAir What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl
@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
@AmericanAir 1138 got us to LGA safely. Thanks for taking the time to make the plane safe before flying!
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/HovuAIsG16” WTF 😂😂😂😂
@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
@united service by staff was great as usual. Cleanliness and smells a bit much. I'll be back. #satisfied traveler
@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
@SouthwestAir how come on mobile I can't proceed w/o entering a postcode at purchase. I'm from Ireland and I don't have a postcode just.
@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
@JetBlue OH YEAH!!! great flight down to Mexico with a wonderful crew!! Thank you!!
@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
@united @suntoshi I still like you united airlines
@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don’t see that it has taken off yet
@USAirways So far....my phone wait time is longer than @ABCNetwork's #Oscars coverage. #WhatCustomerService
@JetBlue why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?!
@AmericanAir thx for responding. I cant watch 2 mins of this film w/out it cutting in and out 4 prolonged prds of time. beyond frustrating
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@SouthwestAir inflight entertainment.  Tonight a Willie Nelson impersonator sang for the passengers #peanutsandtoons http://t.co/kCDdOD7uFF
@USAirways any direct number to dividend miles account info? Every Time I try them I get actually hung up on
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@SouthwestAir Can I get any help with Cancelled Flighting my flight reservation?
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
@SouthwestAir how do I get my companion pass?
@SouthwestAir flight to BOS Cancelled Flightled, no flights till TUESDAY, spent $1000 to get a flight through another airline + $170 for hotel. Refund
@United Global First Class Lounge ORD menu. Yummy! http://t.co/egKvFoKogj
@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!
@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
@JetBlue managers telling us to write a letter because we're upset about our tickets to leave tomorrow getting Cancelled Flightled without any notice
@united DM sent.  Thanks.
@SouthwestAir iPhone app now has passbook support! Whoot! It's the little things in life... 😜
@USAirways Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap.
@JetBlue you guys are lucky I love you
@AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help!
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@united why would they make me share a room?
@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@USAirways flight 813 DCA to CLT stuck waiting on CLT ATC. Cmon #FAA Missing flt 826 CLT to MBJ, hope you can rebook me! 816?
@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. #filmjobnoequipment #nowarmclothes
@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx
@USAirways Painless and effortless flight from Indy to PHL... Our flight attendant, Tory, was fantastic. Give that lady a raise ASAP!
@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@USAirways  redeemed themselves!  Flight out at 7:44!!! Had to call and negotiate,  but thank the Lord I'm heading home!!!!!
@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
@JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me
@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself
Then you better #HoldOn - #EverythingsGonnaBeAlright @jetblue 4 our #brandloveaffair https://t.co/64kN6GEEP8 #TrueBlueLove #travel #business
@SouthwestAir still haven't left @BWI. Maybe by the time I'm suppose to fly back to Austin on Tuesday we'll have moved.
@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@USAirways @AmericanAir 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
alright @JetBlue.... done! alternatively, if you'd like to charter a private jet for me to PITT i will gladly accept :)
@USAirways It's pretty hilarious that you want @SweetingR to finish his awful experience before doing something. Make it right, now.
@JetBlue in the sky on flight 833 from BOS to SFO. Awesome crew! Helene rocks!
@SouthwestAir How can you get your TSA traveler ID added to your boarding pass? Why would it not be included as TSA precheck? Flying tomorro
@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
@AmericanAir On hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever-anyone there?
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
@SouthwestAir my pts expired. I made a prchase @ an online retailer to b told by SW that those won't show for 6-8 wks so too L8 2 keepmy pts
@SouthwestAir thanks!
@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@USAirways Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope.
@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
@USAirways 1899. Thanks
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
@VirginAmerica is saving my sanity right now: http://t.co/ELtBOLjUl9
@USAirways the exhaustion of traveling n runnin thru the airport and tryin 2rent a car n not killin myself my family or anybody on the road
@JetBlue sounds great! Thank you!! :)
@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?
@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
@SouthwestAir Totally sucks that my flights were weathered out of existence, but Stacy in Tucson helped with an overnight in Vegas!
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying
@SouthwestAir why are yall trying to fly me to Chicago when I don't live there?! Send me home now!!!! Bullshit ass customer service
@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA✈️BOS
@JetBlue tried again. Lovely customer service. Thank you!
@AmericanAir we got to 15 minutes AFTER takeoff time before anyone wandered over to address the line of people.
@JetBlue I believe you have to follow me so I can send you a message
“@JetBlue: We’re looking for our next #FlyingItForward flier from DC Tell us where you'd fly &amp; why http://t.co/MCSI0dzpnz” @geekandahalf
@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!
@USAirways getting sorted, thanks
Sir. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/F5IXyw8XyB
@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
@JetBlue @julesdameron "Considering?" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality
@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
@USAirways thanks!
@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
@united If you'd love to see more girls be inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh
@JetBlue will call. Thank you!
😒 "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/K66SRFnw77”
@SouthwestAir How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on.
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united ANOTHER F*CKING DELAY IN THE PAST 32 HOURS!?
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
@AmericanAir It's been 3 weeks and no reply from customer relations yet.  Running out of time, please help.  request: 1-2888155964    thanks
@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
@USAirways how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@AmericanAir My flight through Dallas was Cancelled Flightled and I talked to reservations agent and got a new flight but have not received an email
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir how do you expect to do that?
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
@SouthwestAir three cheers to your Denver staff. Don't know if we will get out but they're keeping us smiling. http://t.co/RX8z53M7yy
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers
@united @estellevw does she need to complain on Twitter for the refund or is it auto-applied?
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
@USAirways please keep Emily at you gso airport ticketing on staff she is amazing
@AmericanAir I'm in MEX.  I need to fly to New York City tomorrow. My new flight on Tuesday is unacceptable. Please help.
@JetBlue Why wasn't a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow?
@USAirways @erickofiejones how long are billing cycles
@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
@SouthwestAir 2 wounded vets stuck. Hv trouble with agent help. On hold and no answer on Twitter. Pls respond
@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@united All flights Cancelled Flighted :( Trip refunded without difficulty, staff extremely helpful, no complaints! Way to handle bad weather!
@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
@JetBlue be flying soon to NYC on your airline, of all airlines I've flown you're still #1 to me 😊😊😊✈️✈️✈️
@united I'm on hold for the 4th time waiting for you to resolve and issue with a flight for my 6-year-old son. #terribleservice #NoService
@SouthwestAir I will never choose @USAirways over you again! #getmeoffthisbird
@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour.
@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????
@NinaDavuluri We think it's a treat to have you onboard! Enjoy your flight. 💙
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
@JetBlue thank you 😊 standing in line now!
@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof
@SouthwestAir you're killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh
@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant
@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
@united can I request a ticket change through twitter ?
@AmericanAir Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@united  gate agent at EWR " if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step". STEP UP??? Lol
@AmericanAir is flight 2934 dfw to gsp going to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
@AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm....
@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
@AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL.
@VirginAmerica Thanks for the lovely soft views! #travel #SAN to #SFO http://t.co/CnctL7G1ef
@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!
@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
@USAirways your rude staff said" I don't care that we are out of market place food you're going on vacation and I have to work" nice huh
@AmericanAir I need HELP!  I'm trying to Cancelled Flight a flight before it takes off but I can't get a hold of ANYONE because all lines are busy.
@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
@USAirways 30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic
@JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare.
@united when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven't booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true?
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight and I'm stranded in St. Louis. Not sure what to do. No other flight until tomorrow. Am I to sleep in airpt
@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
@SouthwestAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@USAirways thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket!
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim
@SouthwestAir There is no way that I am getting back on a plane with your airline. I will be calling to get a refund. As I drive 17 hrs home
@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
@SouthwestAir On hold waiting to make special accommodations for my mom who is traveling 1 hour and 24 minutes on hold.  Unacceptable!
@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
@SouthwestAir Although the wait was long due to weather r/scheduling, a phone call and super rep solved the issue! Thank you!!
@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
@SouthwestAir not if its travel Credit you used to buy and it expires on the day you find a lower rate
@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??
@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@SouthwestAir Travel agent Darrel here at Love Field hosting a paper airplane contest to entertain all the children was so awesome to see!
@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(
@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@SouthwestAir some woman gets on plane and holds 2 seats in the bulkhead for her friends with C boarding passes. I paid $ earlybird thx
@united  RES # 0167560070877     Fsqthg   Thanks
@JetBlue I applied for a job at PDW where could I go for follow up. I'd really love the job #ilovejetblue
@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time
@SouthwestAir Sorry to spam, it would just be so awesome to see @Imaginedragons in Vegas. Your help would be absolutely amazing.
@USAirways yes had to go pick up and pay 40 cab ride very rude employee poor customer service
@JetBlue thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren't so cushy here...!
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@USAirways any chance u can help our family rebook their flight that was Cancelled Flightled, #4487?
@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it.
@united : Unhappy with United's service?Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO.Leave a comment or RT.http://t.co/O0745APIau
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ☺👍👍
@USAirways what's going on in CLT?
@SouthwestAir Worst customer service ever. You Cancelled Flightled my connecting flight to NY hours ago &amp; didn't tell me. Now I'm stuck in Tampa.
@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just "activate" it and surf...
@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!
@SouthwestAir flight 1613 Cancelled Flightled??? My wife is stuck in Phoenix on the way from slc to sanThanks a lot southwest!
@SouthwestAir crazy how every airline flew out to the northeast tonight except you
@SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf# FVF9YW  SWRR# 298033455
@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU. I left my iPad on a plane, filled out a lost and found form. Yall found it and shipped it back. Thank you #flySW
@USAirways on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal!
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add’l fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@AmericanAir originating at SFO and going to LAX.
@VirginAmerica to begin Dallas-Austin #flights in April - 88.9 KETR http://t.co/SSUVWwkyHH
@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@AmericanAir trying to book a flight on hold- can't get through to a representative on the phone- Advice?
@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo
@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
@SouthwestAir Flight 3336 - why do multiple tracking sites have more up to date info than SWA's app and website?
@JetBlue can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes
@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
@united I’m resending the confirmation code in a DM
@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
@southwestair yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@JetBlue Thank you that it is not just a livery; it is a culture that 16,000+ crewmembers embody daily #thanksDave http://t.co/iNNP0Kkyby
@AmericanAir done.
@SouthwestAir once or twice a year. Hard to get vacation time from work sometimes. But love flying with you guys!
@JetBlue sounds good!!!💙💙💙💙
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
@AmericanAir Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????
@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow
@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
@JetBlue or she ;)
@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!
@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@JetBlue awesome, thanks! on hold now.
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though.
“@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?” Spring Break !!!
@USAirways all these planes sitting here and no one going home. #usairwaysfail http://t.co/jN3V3k3qGv
@VirginAmerica nervous about my flight from DC to LAX getting Cancelled Flightled tomorrow! Just sent you a DM to help me!
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday.
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m
@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
“@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!” Thank you!
@united it's boarding time for ua3882 but no crewe
@JetBlue offered to pay for tix at the airport BC we were never told that our reservation didn't go through. Was told I could pay $2275 pp.
@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@SouthwestAir, rude customer svc, won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice
@SouthwestAir  THANK YOU for your awesome flights. Sweetheart got screwed on @FlyFrontier, managed to scramble and get a SW plane today. !!!
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated.
@USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far
@USAirways thank you for putting me on a flight that will be leaving Late Flightr than the original flight I was booked on.
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@SouthwestAir did you pick the winners for the #DestinationDragons ?? #87yearsLate Flightr #maybeijustlost #whyyounoloveme
@AmericanAir after several miss communications I was able to get to ORD but I am not home yet and not sure I will get there due to her error
@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
@usairways 2+ hr wait &amp; really bad exp @PHLAirport. luggage won't arrive w/ me Do I really have 2go back LAS airport 2 pick up when arrives?
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@SouthwestAir how many are left?!
@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to "heavy call volume."
@united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say "we are experiencing high call volume" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
@SouthwestAir Karen with customer service was very helpful. Thank you for providing one bright spot in a frustrating situation.
@united please be good to me this weekend!
@SouthwestAir Any chance there's a few seats open from DEN to DAL this afternoon?
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@AmericanAir do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?
@USAirways Need to talk to a person about my bag. Waiting on hold for two hours. Bag s!b delivered last night. Online says not found.
@USAirways 603 &amp; 2705 DFW to PSP thank you!
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?
@USAirways flight #654 sitting at JFK with delays for 3-1/2 hrs! No employees to load bags? #terrible
@AmericanAir thanks 😩. idk if it still Late Flight but I hope I get it tonight 😭
@USAirways he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted
@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info

@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
@JetBlue we have just landed, thank you anyway. Btw, flight staff on flight 654 were wonderful despite their full day and heavy load.
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.
@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.

@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
@USAirways Will do :)
@AmericanAir what name and department does it come under? Thanks
@AmericanAir flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?
@USAirways you're killing me from the inside
@SouthwestAir When does the new schedule open that takes us past 10/31?
@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?
@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because...
@SouthwestAir sent!
@united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err "no segment in this"
STAHHPPP!!! RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/VHFJGneOZO
@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
@SouthwestAir - been on hold forever. My first flight was Cancelled Flightled but my 2nd flight is still on time - HELP!
@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
@united you had us REBOARD without the captain.  So now we'll be sitting in here for another 20+ min? http://t.co/EEReKDf9Fq
@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on

@AmericanAir Am on web site requesting refund for Cancelled Flightled flight. It requires numerical document number. Where get it?
@USAirways your mobile app is horrible!  Needs a major overhaul
@SouthwestAir it's never too Late Flight to do the right thing
@VirginAmerica Thank you!!
@JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet!
@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@JetBlue Thanks for the $100 credit because of the 4hr delay. I can tell customer service means a lot to YOU #Thankful
@united What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
@USAirways @AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one

@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” inconvience*
@SouthwestAir Thanks! I know the routes you currently have from Newark. I was just wondering if there was any new ones on the horizon
“@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP” Done!

@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
@united thanks
@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43

@AmericanAir But Eagle is always Late Flight
@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
@SouthwestAir gimme
@SouthwestAir Southwest Airline is THE way to go!
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@AmericanAir "overweight" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.
@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation..
@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
@SouthwestAir sign me up!
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don’t need this much trouble.
@united this is atrocious customer service.
@JetBlue hi I flew with your airline once in Australia and saw zero kangaroos. Had this been rectified
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
@SouthwestAir fl 4158 Cancelled Flightled from Dallas to Austin. No one answering 800#.  Need help.
@AmericanAir sure, thank you!
@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
@SouthwestAir has the worst customer service on earth. Will never fly that airline again.
@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
@JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers
@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@JetBlue it says it is now 9:58 you owe me
@USAirways how does that help me when I get no response from there??? #usairwayssucks
@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold
@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
@JetBlue tough choices but I did all simultaneously! As a business traveler, best experience in a long time. #wishmyflightwaslonger #what
@JetBlue How can I check that? I do not believe I was given a credit for that automatically. :/
@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@JetBlue should I check in my awesome bag on my flight or carry it on... Decisions...
@USAirways You all work hard at making sure things flow smoothly. Keeping positive.
@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
@united awesome thank you very much for the help
@USAirways Thank you so much its been a very stressful day
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! http://t.co/nmbHNGnMkI
@SouthwestAir I did but it only shows one flight one way. When I try to go to the home page and book roundtrip there's nothing available :(
@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!
@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
@VirginAmerica I adore you, and am so looking forward to my flight to Austin in two weeks.
@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
@JetBlue tell the truth - this is a pic of your social media community managers isn't it? http://t.co/e2AXlqzWvh

“@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH” always blame the customer
@JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone
@JetBlue Really!? That's good to hear! Thanks for the update @walls29 We may make that business meeting after all.
@SouthwestAir no thanks
@USAirways still can't get through and travel in 2 days. #ridiculous #donthavehighhopes
@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
@SouthwestAir All good... beers and #oscars2015 ar #DIA
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
@SouthwestAir- ...was only less than 3500pts, but it helped. Had PartnerRewards incoming, but not fast enough to keep pts from expiring.
@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@JetBlue Flight Booking Problems flights for a DC visit for Easter weekend started difficult but ended well with you guys! Big fan here. :)
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@united Stuck in this airport 12 hours in standbys cuz the pilot showed up Late Flight in PJs &amp; i missed my connectin flight. PJ's I TELL U! #NYFW

@SouthwestAir what to do when you show up to your destination with no clothes in your suitcase? #nakedmeetings #awkward
@SouthwestAir's CEO Kelly draws record crowd to @BWI_Airport Business Partnership breakfast http://t.co/hrvuKtpvn1 http://t.co/MY3dnVBZAZ
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers
@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered
@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :)
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir made it!  Thanks AA!
@VirginAmerica hahaha 😂@VirginAmerica YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!💗
@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!
@VirginAmerica cutest salt and pepper shaker ever. Just when I think you guys can't get any better you just do! http://t.co/vC6Keulg2J
@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response.  When I book I've tried my AA number and my US Airways number and each time it doesn't pick it up
@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?
@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv
@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
@AmericanAir i got a new reservation for tomorrow. Thanks!
@USAirways @AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I'm gonna let you finish, but I've been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher.
@AmericanAir "bag has not yet been located". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH
@USAirways Discovered our flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday at 3:30PM - @americanairlnes finally notified us our flight was Cancelled Flighted at 0316 AM
@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you.
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@USAirways on hold for 1 hour and 14 min trying to find the luggage flight Cancelled Flightled where is luggage? http://t.co/i1SfMI7zat
@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow 😭
@AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts
@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz club Virgin is bumping in New York http://t.co/HaQc7GDg7c
@USAirways @AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this??
@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
@SouthwestAir rocks - @AmericanAir horror
@USAirways Yes, there is horrible snow. But seriously, can you not hire more people to answer the phones? Competitor have call back numbers.
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
@USAirways @AmericanAir  Also your on-hold message is trying to sell Valentines Day gifts.  Over a week Late Flight.  Sounds about right for USAir
@JetBlue Does your home airport not count in the badge system? My TB account says 2 flights but I've taken 3 this year.
@JetBlue     Is it only $50 for my 2nd bag?  1st bag too full..
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.
@SouthwestAir Deborah helped me💁
@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
@SouthwestAir nvm, gate said they're holding connections. Thanks for quick response!
@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.
@JetBlue saved the day:) @Expedia lost a costumer #jetblue #makingthingseasy #feelbetter
@JetBlue flying w/ infant for the 1st time, can I bring a canister of powder formula for a carry on and/or use my plastic formula divider?
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
@SouthwestAir I already follow you and can't DM because u need to follow me back
@AmericanAir please help my flight appears Cancelled Flight 1503 from ft. Lauderdale to Dallas to LAX. Is there anything leaving from Mia or FLL? ThxU
@JetBlue are you going to be giving travel agent rates to those who hold an Iata card ???
@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
@jetblue I hate you for this 😒 https://t.co/g4WwR6VBRQ
@united online inchecking able in the Netherlands (ams)?
@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account.
@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
@JetBlue if I tell you I like that @warriors pick, will that get me that bump to first class? :)
@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent.
@AmericanAir No, it wouldn't let me complete transaction because it was one way from Barbados to NYC
@JetBlue okay awesome! Thank you!
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@AmericanAir thank you!
@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ
@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAKJMF
@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@USAirways is absolute crap this week!!
@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
@SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@AmericanAir Please bring American Airlines to #BlackBerry10
@SouthwestAir how oh how do we get tickets! ?!
@JetBlue yes, with about 20 minutes to spare.  FYI - your employees are amazing.  Keep up the good work!
@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???
@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage.
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
@VirginAmerica done! Thank you for the quick response, apparently faster than sitting on hold ;)
“@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT” A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one.
@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
@USAirways a big thanks to the gate agent flt5127..keeping us informed of the delay#greatcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next @AmericanAir #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
@USAirways Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO
@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
@SouthwestAir Great flight yesterday from MSY to AUS!! Thank you for such great safety,service and beautiful skies!! http://t.co/X1EqYAHfvZ
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
@JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International.
@SouthwestAir y'all the real MVP with these prices...
@SouthwestAir much respect!
@AmericanAir 48 hours and still no bag. Could have flown to Costa Rica and back by now. I had gifts for my family in my bags.
@JetBlue Yes That's true but they are a bit pricey I will look into it further. Love you guys.
@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The "weather" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fiancée are stuck in BOS!
@JetBlue Thanks.
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
@SouthwestAir Whoa. Thanks and that's what I wanted to hear! Early flight coming up. Thanks for the reply.
@AmericanAir I tried to book a rwrd and was told I couldnt. Bought tix on USAir (now AA-no choice) didn't bother to + AAdv# with this svc...
@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@USAirways I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy
@AmericanAir HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@USAirways I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt
@SouthwestAir would you be willing to help me surprise my bestfriend with tickets to go see @Imaginedragons? #DestinationDragons Gracias!
@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
@jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting "We are not able to sign you in" msg.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
@AmericanAir Thank you
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
@JetBlue I would like to receive offers.
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
@JetBlue quick question, to pay for a second bag, do I have to do it online or can I do it at the airport?
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@JetBlue Thank you guys! Brilliant customer service
@AmericanAir you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The "status" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted.
@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch "Buy"
There were plenty of empty seats in coach "@united: Your dissatisfaction is understood. Crew members traveling for duty are pre-booked on f"
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir @USAirways wonderful FC FA on flight 2062 pre dawn!  Nice start to the day!
@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
@AmericanAir Hey AA - can you help with an itinerary for a plat custy?  Stuck in PVR and phones aren't working
@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
@USAirways and if the flight is full?
@USAirways Im researching a flight &amp; noticed a small issue w/class of service between your site &amp; other sites. Could Reservations help me?
@southwestair Landed an hour Late Flight from IND to DEN, and 40+ min Late Flightr, our bags are not here. Not cool.
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@united I am - thank you!
@SouthwestAir I have a child traveling cross country...she's 11 will be turning 12 in march...and (cont) http://t.co/Enh1keUUTd
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@USAirways please give Tara G a pat on the back and praise.  She was very very helpful.  She is at PHL member lounge
“@USAirways: @ch_mom Please reach out to our crewmember for assistance. Our apologies for the long wait.” #generic
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline
@USAirways you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!!
@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@JetBlue @JetBlueCheeps My friend bought a ticket last night for one of these routes from you, and it cost way more. Can you help?”
@VirginAmerica to jump into the #Dallas #Austin market http://t.co/SzR0pioA21
@SouthwestAir flight 1028 no delayed 1.5 hours.  Another week another delayed flight
@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board
@AmericanAir Thanks! He is.
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@SouthwestAir that's awesome! Love flying SWA!
1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - @TheVDT http://t.co/VD0tLomtwu
@JetBlue Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
@united Thanks, I will!
@JetBlue had a great flight to Orlando from Hartford a few weeks ago! Was great to get out on time and arrive early!
@VirginAmerica Dad on Segway is the best part of this whole infographic!
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@JetBlue ok is I hope thy the Bahamas next
@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@southwestair#SWADiversity We are ready to be inspired! http://t.co/S3EsW5AgUm
@AmericanAir I will thank you. What do I do if I can't get through and my flight on hold Cancelled Flights?
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?
@JetBlue Haha you're doing everything right! Don't change a thing! Slash this Twitter engagement just makes you even cooler! #bestairline
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@VirginAmerica thank goodness!! Also, see you friday, nwk&gt;sf.. BOOM!
@VirginAmerica Done, but I need the receipt ASAP. Could you please help? #150219-000114
@VirginAmerica was wondering if you guys recieved my dm and we're able to potentially respond asap
@SouthwestAir i like to see if i can change flight plz help thx
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.
@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay
@SouthwestAir thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg.
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
@VirginAmerica this is great news!  America could start flights to Hawaii by end of year http://t.co/r8p2Zy3fe4 via @Pacificbiznews
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@AmericanAir @Slacksoft_uk I saw an American 767 in old colours at @HeathrowAirport on Saturday! Was surprised to see!
@USAirways 3818 delayed. blue skies all over. #whyisusairALWAYSDELAYED???
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3kVkd8yRxa” + lol wow
@SouthwestAir when you're on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ
@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
Nice RT @VirginAmerica: The man of steel might be faster, but we have WiFi – just saying. #ScienceBehindTheExperience http://t.co/FGRbpAZSiX
.@JetBlue Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
@AmericanAir yes, it says it should be deliver within 6 hours after pick up line.
@SouthwestAir :arrived in San Juan early. Thanks for a great flight. LUV u!
@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
@JetBlue just touched down in #NewOrleans for the annual @HeinekenUSACorp national distributor conference! #livethelegend
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in.
@JetBlue no. Did not catch his name. I am sure Jason will know.
@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
@united Ok thank again for your help!
@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
