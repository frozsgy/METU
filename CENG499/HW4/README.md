# CENG499 - Homework 4

## How to Run

1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install `numpy` library through `pip`
3. Run scripts that you'd want to test

## Required Libraries
* Numpy

## Project Structure

* `nb.py`: Naive Bayes methods
* `nb_calculate.py`: Calculates NB result of the dataset
* `hmm.py`: Hidden Markov Model methods
* `nb.out`: Result of Naive Bayes calculation of the dataset

## Naive Bayes Results

With the given dataset, my program has an accuracy of 75%. The calculation takes approximately 50 seconds on ineks.
