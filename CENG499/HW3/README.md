# CENG499 - Homework 3

## How to Run

1. Create a Python virtual environment
2. Install required libraries through `pip`
3. Run scripts that you'd want to test

## Required Libraries
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn


## Project Structure

* `plots`: contains all plots and logs (if available)
* `svm_part_1.py`: solution for SVM Part 1
* `svm_part_2.py`: solution for SVM Part 2
* `svm_part_3.py`: solution for SVM Part 3
* `svm_part_4.py`: solution for SVM Part 4
* `svm_part_3_values.py`: util script to parse values of SVM Part 3 from the raw output log
* `dt.py`: decision tree implementation
* `draw.py`: util script to plot diagrams
* `dt_mini_tester.py`: decision tree mini tester
* `requirements.txt`: pip freeze output, required pip packages with versions

## ID3 Implementation

Unfortunately I could not finish the ID3 implementation, and because of that it is not in the submission files. However, I completed the `dt.py` methods, and they work as expected.
