- UML Diagram

To keep the UML diagram less cluttered and simple, I omitted most of the generic getter & setter methods, and standart constructors. For a full list of aforementioned methods, you may refer to the source code.


- Code taken from an online resource

For centering texts within the GUI, I created a method inside the Country and Agent classes named as drawCenteredString. This method (3 lines, to center the text within the GUI only) is taken from the https://coderanch.com/t/336616/java/Center-Align-text-drawString resource, and modified slightly.
