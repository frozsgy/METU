# CENG 443 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming Languages and Systems

## Course Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Use major object-oriented technologies and tools that are covered in the course.
* Apply major object-oriented design principles when designing software systems.
* Point out the advantages and disadvantages of various object-oriented solutions.
* Evaluate and compare existing system designs in terms of flexibility and modularity.
* Identify and revise components of existing system designs for better performance.
* Create UML class diagrams to model software systems with realistic requirements.
* Design and implement object-oriented software solutions to realistic problems.


## Course Content

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts. Exception handling. I/O Streams and Decorator Pattern. Concurrency. GUI Development. Security Issues. Objects over Networks. Database Connectivity. Serialization and Deserialization. Remote Method Calls. Introduction to Enterprise Components. 

## Homeworks

All homeworks use Java 8, and a codebase was provided for each of the assignments. We were not allowed to change the codebase, and only the parts marked with `TODO` can be updated, therefore there are some limitations and not-so-optimal design choices at some parts of my implementations.

### [Homework 1](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG443/HW1)

A GUI and business logic implementation of an animation about countries buying/selling gold and intelligence agencies intercepting these orders, and the accompanying UML diagram.

### [Homework 2](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG443/HW2)

A multithreaded application of a smart factory that aims to coordinate robots(threads) and provide the desired output through synchronization tools. 

### [Homework 3](https://github.com/frozsgy/METU/tree/master/CENG443/HW3)

Implementation of a Student Information System using Java 8 Stream API.
