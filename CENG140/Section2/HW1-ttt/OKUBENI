Just move your binary here, then type bash tester.sh.
If you are paranoid, you may want to regenarate test numbers.

Note that if there will be a segmentation fault, or an infinite loop, it is probably because of the uncompleted termination function in your code.

Also note that, since the first turn is randomly chosen it is very difficult to compare results. To compare, tester tries 20 time and expects at least 1 success.

Good Luck!
